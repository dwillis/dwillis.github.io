    "text": "Why do teams struggle? There are lots of potential reasons: injuries, athletes in the wrong position, poor execution. Or it could be external factors: well-prepared opponents, the weather, the altitude or, of course, the refs.\nYou could turn the question around: why do teams succeed? Again, there are plenty of possibilities that get tossed around on talk radio, on the sports pages and across social media. A lot of hot takes.\nThe more fundamental question that this course will empower you to answer is this: what do teams and athletes do? Using data, you’ll learn to ask questions and visualize the answers, ranging across sports and scenarios. What did the 2021-22 Maryland men’s lacrosse team do well en route to the national championship? How has the transfer portal (and additional eligibility) changed the nature of programs? In football, do penalties have any relationship on scoring?\nTo get into these and other questions, we’ll use a lot of different tools and techniques, but this class rests on three pillars:\n\nSimple, easy to understand statistics …\n… extracted using simple code …\n… visualized simply to reveal new and interesting things in sports.\n\nDo you need to be a math whiz to read this book? No. I’m not one either. What we’re going to look at is pretty basic, but that’s also why it’s so powerful.\nDo you need to be a computer science major to write code? Nope. I’m not one of those either. But anyone can think logically, and write simple code that is repeatable and replicable.\nDo you need to be an artist to create compelling visuals? I think you see where this is going. No. I can barely draw stick figures, but I’ve been paid to make graphics in my career. With a little graphic design know how, you can create publication worthy graphics with code.\n\n\nThis book is all in the R statistical language. To follow along, you’ll do the following:\n\nInstall the R language on your computer. Go to the R Project website, click download R and select a mirror closest to your location. Then download the version for your computer.\nInstall R Studio Desktop. The free version is great.\n\nGoing forward, you’ll see passages like this:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nDon’t do it now, but that is code that you’ll need to run in your R Studio. When you see that, you’ll know what to do.\n\n\n\nThis book is the collection of class materials for the Fall 2022 JOUR479X course in the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. There’s some things you should know about it:\n\nIt is free for students.\nThe topics will remain the same but the text is going to be constantly tinkered with.\nWhat is the work of the author is copyright Derek Willis 2022 & Matt Waite 2019.\nThe text is Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Creative Commons licensed.

    "text": "R is a programming language, one specifically geared toward statistical analysis. Like all programming languages, it has certain built-in functions and you can interact with it in multiple ways. The first, and most basic, is the console.\nThink of the console like talking directly to R. It’s direct, but it has some drawbacks and some quirks we’ll get into later. For now, try typing this into the console and hit enter:\nCongrats, you’ve run some code. It’s not very complex, and you knew the answer before hand, but you get the idea. We can compute things. We can also store things. In programming languages, these are called variables. We can assign things to variables using <-. And then we can do things with them. The <- is a called an assignment operator.\nNow assign a different number to the variable number. Try running number * number again. Get what you expected?\nWe can have as many variables as we can name. We can even reuse them (but be careful you know you’re doing that or you’ll introduce errors). Try this in your console.\nWe can store anything in a variable. A whole table. An array of numbers. Every college basketball game played in the last 10 years. A single word. A whole book. All the books of the 18th century. They’re really powerful. We’ll explore them at length."

The base language can do a lot, but it’s the external libraries that solve many specific problems – even making the base language easier to use.\nFor this class, we’re going to need several external libraries.\nThe first library we’re going to use is called Swirl. So in the console, type install.packages('swirl') and hit enter. That installs swirl.\nNow, to use the library, type library(swirl) and hit enter. That loads swirl. Then type swirl() and hit enter. Now you’re running swirl. Follow the directions on the screen. When you are asked, you want to install course 1 R Programming: The basics of programming in R. Then, when asked, you want to do option 1, R Programming, in that course.\nWhen you are finished with the course – it will take just a few minutes – it will first ask you if you want credit on Coursera. You do not. Then type 0 to exit (it will not be very clear that’s what you do when you are done)."

In notebooks, you will both run your code and explain each step, much as I am doing here.\nTo start a notebook, you click on the green plus in the top left corner and go down to R Notebook. Do that now.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see that the notebook adds a lot of text for you. It tells you how to work in notebooks – and you should read it. The most important parts are these:\nTo add text, simply type. To add code you can click on the Insert button on the toolbar or by pressing Cmd+Option+I on Mac or Ctl+Alt+I on Windows.\nHighlight all that text and delete it. You should have a blank document. This document is called a R Markdown file – it’s a special form of text, one that you can style, and one you can include R in the middle of it. Markdown is a simple markup format that you can use to create documents. So first things first, let’s give our notebook a big headline. Add this:\n# My awesome notebook\nNow, under that, without any markup, just type This is my awesome notebook.\nUnder that, you can make text bold by writing It is **really** awesome.\nIf you want it italics, just do this on the next line: No, it's _really_ awesome. I swear.\nTo see what it looks like without the markup, click the Preview or Knit button in the toolbar. That will turn your notebook into a webpage, with the formatting included.\nThroughout this book, we’re going to use this markdown to explain what we are doing and, more importantly, why we are doing it. Explaining your thinking is a vital part of understanding what you are doing.\nThat explaination, plus the code, is the real power of notebooks. To add a block of code, follow the instructions from above: click on the Insert button on the toolbar or by pressing Cmd+Option+I on Mac or Ctl+Alt+I on Windows.\nIn that window, use some of the code from above and add two numbers together. To see it run, click the green triangle on the right. That runs the chunk. You should see the answer to your addition problem.\nAnd that, just that, is the foundation you need to start this book."

Your online life. Any time you buy something. It’s everywhere. Sports, like life, is no different. Sports is drowning in data, and more comes along all the time.\nIn sports, and in this class, we’ll be dealing largely with two kinds of data: event level data and summary data. It’s not hard to envision event level data in sports. A pitch in baseball. A hit. A play in football. A pass in soccer. They are the events that make up the game. Combine them together – summarize them – and you’ll have some notion of how the game went. What we usually see is summary data – who wants to scroll through 50 pitches to find out a player went 2-3 with a double and an RBI? Who wants to scroll through hundreds of pitches to figure out the Rays beat the Yankees?\nTo start with, we need to understand the shape of data."

The third is their batting average. And so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the critical components of data analysis, especially for beginners, is having a mental picture of your data. What does each row mean?

In this class, we’re primarily going to be dealing with data frames, and each element of our data frames will have a data type.\nTypically, they’ll be one of four types of data:\n\nNumeric: a number, like the number of touchdown passes in a season or a batting average.\nCharacter: Text, like a name, a team, a conference.\nDate: Fully formed dates – 2019-01-01 – have a special date type. Elements of a date, like a year (ex. 2019) are not technically dates, so they’ll appear as numeric data types.\nLogical: Rare, but every now and then we’ll have a data type that’s Yes or No, True or False, etc.\n\nQuestion: Is a zip code a number? Is a jersey number a number? Trick question, because the answer is no. Numbers are things we do math on. If the thing you want is not something you’re going to do math on – can you add two phone numbers together? – then make it a character type. If you don’t, most every software system on the planet will drop leading zeros. For example, every zip code in Boston starts with 0. If you record that as a number, your zip code will become a four digit number, which isn’t a zip code anymore."

You can tell by putting your cursor on that field, where you’ll see the formula again. This is where you’d look:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution is easy:\nEdit > Select All or type command/control A Edit > Copy or type command/control c Edit > Paste Special > Values Only or type command/control shift v\nYou can verify that it worked by looking in that same row 1 column A, where you’ll see the formula is gone.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you have data, but your headers are all wrong. You want your headers to be one line – not two, like they have. And the header names repeat – first for our team, then for theirs. So you have to change each header name to be UsORB or TeamORB and OpponentORB instead of just ORB.\nAfter you’ve done that, note we have repeating headers. There’s two ways to deal with that – you could just hightlight it and go up to Edit > Delete Rows XX-XX depending on what rows you highlighted. That’s the easy way with our data.\nBut what if you had hundreds of repeating headers like that? Deleting them would take a long time.\nYou can use sorting to get rid of anything that’s not data. So click on Data > Sort Range. You’ll want to check the “Data has header row” field. Then hit Sort.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow all you need to do is search through the data for where your junk data – extra headers, blanks, etc. – got sorted and delete it. After you’ve done that, you can export it for use in R. Go to File > Download as > Comma Separated Values.

We already installed the tidyverse – or you should have if you followed the instructions for the last assignment – which isn’t exactly a library, but a collection of libraries. Together, they make up the tidyverse. Individually, they are extraordinarily useful for what they do. We can load them all at once using the tidyverse name, or we can load them individually. Let’s start with individually.\nThe two libraries we are going to need for this assignment are readr and dplyr. The library readr reads different types of data in as a dataframe. For this assignment, we’re going to read in csv data or Comma Separated Values data. That’s data that has a comma between each column of data.\nThen we’re going to use dplyr to analyze it.\nTo use a library, you need to import it. Good practice – one I’m going to insist on – is that you put all your library steps at the top of your notebook.\nThat code looks like this:\nTo load them both, you need to run that code twice:\nYou can keep doing that for as many libraries as you need. I’ve seen notebooks with 10 or more library imports.\nBut the tidyverse has a neat little trick.

    "section": "4.1 Basic data analysis: Group By and Count",
    "text": "4.1 Basic data analysis: Group By and Count\nThe first thing we need to do is get some data to work with. We do that by reading it in. In our case, we’re going to read data from a csv file – a comma-separated values file.\nThe CSV file we’re going to read from is a Basketball Reference page of advanced metrics for NBA players this past season. The Sports Reference sites are a godsend of data, a trove of stuff, and we’re going to use it a lot in this class.\nFor this walkthrough:\n   Download csv file\n\nSo step 2, after setting up our libraries, is most often going to be importing data. In order to analyze data, we need data, so it stands to reason that this would be something we’d do very early.\nThe code looks something like this, but hold off copying it just yet:\nnbaplayers <- read_csv(\"~/SportsData/nbaadvancedplayers2122.csv\")\nLet’s unpack that.\nThe first part – nbaplayers – is the name of your variable. A variable is just a name of a thing that stores stuff. In this case, our variable is a data frame, which is R’s way of storing data (technically it’s a tibble, which is the tidyverse way of storing data, but the differences aren’t important and people use them interchangeably). We can call this whatever we want. I always want to name data frames after what is in it. In this case, we’re going to import a dataset of NBA players. Variable names, by convention are one word all lower case. You can end a variable with a number, but you can’t start one with a number.\nThe <- bit is the variable assignment operator. It’s how we know we’re assigning something to a word. Think of the arrow as saying “Take everything on the right of this arrow and stuff it into the thing on the left.” So we’re creating an empty vessel called nbaplayers and stuffing all this data into it.\nThe read_csv bits are pretty obvious, except for one thing. What happens in the quote marks is the path to the data. In there, I have to tell R where it will find the data. The easiest thing to do, if you are confused about how to find your data, is to put your data in the same folder as as your notebook (you’ll have to save that notebook first). If you do that, then you just need to put the name of the file in there (nbaadvancedplayers2122.csv). In my case, in my home directory (that’s the ~ part), there is a folder called SportsData that has the file called nbaadvancedplayers2122.csv in it. Some people – insane people – leave the data in their downloads folder. The data path then would be ~/Downloads/nameofthedatafilehere.csv on PC or Mac.\nWhat you put in there will be different from mine. So your first task is to import the data.\n\nnbaplayers <- read_csv(\"data/nbaadvancedplayers2122.csv\")\n\nNew names:\nRows: 812 Columns: 29\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(3): Player, Pos, Tm dbl (24): Rk, Age, G, MP, PER, TS%, 3PAr, FTr, ORB%, DRB%,\nTRB%, AST%, STL%,... lgl (2): ...20, ...25\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -> `...20`\n• `` -> `...25`\n\n\nNow we can inspect the data we imported. What does it look like? To do that, we use head(nbaplayers) to show the headers and the first six rows of data. If we wanted to see them all, we could just simply enter nbaplayers and run it.\nTo get the number of records in our dataset, we run nrow(nbaplayers)\n\nhead(nbaplayers)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 29\n     Rk Player     Pos     Age Tm        G    MP   PER `TS%` `3PAr`   FTr `ORB%`\n  <dbl> <chr>      <chr> <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>\n1     1 Precious … C        22 TOR      73  1725  12.7 0.503  0.259 0.217    8.7\n2     2 Steven Ad… C        28 MEM      76  1999  17.6 0.56   0.003 0.518   17.9\n3     3 Bam Adeba… C        24 MIA      56  1825  21.8 0.608  0.008 0.466    8.7\n4     4 Santi Ald… PF       21 MEM      32   360  10.2 0.452  0.364 0.242    9.4\n5     5 LaMarcus … C        36 BRK      47  1050  19.6 0.604  0.1   0.223    7.8\n6     6 Nickeil A… SG       23 TOT      65  1466  10.5 0.475  0.497 0.16     2.7\n# … with 17 more variables: `DRB%` <dbl>, `TRB%` <dbl>, `AST%` <dbl>,\n#   `STL%` <dbl>, `BLK%` <dbl>, `TOV%` <dbl>, `USG%` <dbl>, ...20 <lgl>,\n#   OWS <dbl>, DWS <dbl>, WS <dbl>, `WS/48` <dbl>, ...25 <lgl>, OBPM <dbl>,\n#   DBPM <dbl>, BPM <dbl>, VORP <dbl>\n\n\n\nnrow(nbaplayers)\n\n[1] 812\n\n\nAnother way to look at nrow – we have 812 players from this season in our dataset.\nWhat if we wanted to know how many players there were by position? To do that by hand, we’d have to take each of the 651 records and sort them into a pile. We’d put them in groups and then count them.\ndplyr has a group by function in it that does just this. A massive amount of data analysis involves grouping like things together at some point. So it’s a good place to start.\nSo to do this, we’ll take our dataset and we’ll introduce a new operator: %>%. The best way to read that operator, in my opinion, is to interpret that as “and then do this.”\nAfter we group them together, we need to count them. We do that first by saying we want to summarize our data (a count is a part of a summary). To get a summary, we have to tell it what we want. So in this case, we want a count. To get that, let’s create a thing called total and set it equal to n(), which is dplyrs way of counting something.\nHere’s the code:\n\nnbaplayers %>%\n  group_by(Pos) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total = n()\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 2\n   Pos   total\n   <chr> <int>\n 1 C       130\n 2 C-PF      2\n 3 PF      152\n 4 PF-SF     1\n 5 PG      156\n 6 PG-SG     1\n 7 SF      157\n 8 SF-SG     5\n 9 SG      199\n10 SG-PG     4\n11 SG-SF     5\n\n\nSo let’s walk through that. We start with our dataset – nbaplayers – and then we tell it to group the data by a given field in the data which we get by looking at either the output of head or you can look in the environment where you’ll see nbaplayers.\nIn this case, we wanted to group together positions, signified by the field name Pos. After we group the data, we need to count them up. In dplyr, we use summarize which can do more than just count things. Inside the parentheses in summarize, we set up the summaries we want. In this case, we just want a count of the positions: total = n(), says create a new field, called total and set it equal to n(), which might look weird, but it’s common in stats. The number of things in a dataset? Statisticians call in n. There are n number of players in this dataset. So n() is a function that counts the number of things there are.\nAnd when we run that, we get a list of positions with a count next to them. But it’s not in any order. So we’ll add another And Then Do This %>% and use arrange. Arrange does what you think it does – it arranges data in order. By default, it’s in ascending order – smallest to largest. But if we want to know the county with the most mountain lion sightings, we need to sort it in descending order. That looks like this:\n\nnbaplayers %>%\n  group_by(Pos) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total = n()\n  ) %>% arrange(desc(total))\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 2\n   Pos   total\n   <chr> <int>\n 1 SG      199\n 2 SF      157\n 3 PG      156\n 4 PF      152\n 5 C       130\n 6 SF-SG     5\n 7 SG-SF     5\n 8 SG-PG     4\n 9 C-PF      2\n10 PF-SF     1\n11 PG-SG     1\n\n\nSo the most common position in the NBA? Shooting guard, followed by small forward (although it’s close between SF and point guard).\nWe can, if we want, group by more than one thing. Which team has the most of a single position? To do that, we can group by the team – called Tm in the data – and position, or Pos in the data:\n\nnbaplayers %>%\n  group_by(Tm, Pos) %>%\n  summarise(\n    total = n()\n  ) %>% arrange(desc(total))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Tm'. You can override using the `.groups`\nargument.\n\n\n# A tibble: 161 × 3\n# Groups:   Tm [31]\n   Tm    Pos   total\n   <chr> <chr> <int>\n 1 TOT   PF       18\n 2 TOT   SG       18\n 3 TOT   PG       17\n 4 TOT   SF       14\n 5 TOT   C        12\n 6 BOS   SG        9\n 7 DAL   PG        9\n 8 LAC   SG        9\n 9 POR   SF        9\n10 SAS   SG        9\n# … with 151 more rows\n\n\nSo wait, what team is TOT?\nValuable lesson: whoever collects the data has opinions on how to solve problems. In this case, Basketball Reference, when a player get’s traded, records stats for the player’s first team, their second team, and a combined season total for a team called TOT, meaning Total. Is there a team abbreviated TOT? No. So ignore them here.\nBoston has 8 shooting guards. Dallas has 9 point guards? You can learn a bit about how a team is assembled by looking at these simple counts."

Here, we’ll use R’s built in mean and median functions to calculate … well, you get the idea.\nLet’s look just a the number of minutes each position gets.\n\nnbaplayers %>%\n  group_by(Pos) %>%\n  summarise(\n    count = n(),\n    mean_minutes = mean(MP),\n    median_minutes = median(MP)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 4\n   Pos   count mean_minutes median_minutes\n   <chr> <int>        <dbl>          <dbl>\n 1 C       130         835.           616 \n 2 C-PF      2        1506.          1506.\n 3 PF      152         842.           502.\n 4 PF-SF     1        1940           1940 \n 5 PG      156         815.           543 \n 6 PG-SG     1        2419           2419 \n 7 SF      157         775.           491 \n 8 SF-SG     5        1074.           935 \n 9 SG      199         821.           665 \n10 SG-PG     4        1350.          1340.\n11 SG-SF     5         654.           434 \n\n\nSo there’s 812 players in the data. Let’s look at shooting guards. The average shooting guard plays 820 minutes and the median is 665 minutes.\nWhy?\nLet’s let sort help us.\n\nnbaplayers %>% arrange(desc(MP))\n\n# A tibble: 812 × 29\n      Rk Player    Pos     Age Tm        G    MP   PER `TS%` `3PAr`   FTr `ORB%`\n   <dbl> <chr>     <chr> <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>\n 1    66 Mikal Br… SF       25 PHO      82  2854  14.4 0.627  0.364 0.183    2.9\n 2    67 Miles Br… PF       23 CHO      80  2837  17.9 0.593  0.383 0.274    3.3\n 3   134 DeMar De… PF       32 CHI      76  2743  23.1 0.59   0.093 0.386    2.3\n 4   526 Jayson T… SF       23 BOS      76  2731  21.8 0.578  0.416 0.3      3.5\n 5    47 Saddiq B… SF       22 DET      82  2704  14   0.529  0.537 0.224    4.1\n 6   214 Tyrese H… SG-PG    21 TOT      77  2695  18.2 0.595  0.428 0.209    2.5\n 7   576 Russell … PG       33 LAL      78  2678  15   0.512  0.215 0.324    4.4\n 8   602 Trae You… PG       23 ATL      76  2652  25.4 0.603  0.395 0.358    2.1\n 9   358 Tyrese M… PG       21 PHI      75  2650  16.2 0.594  0.311 0.247    1.1\n10   168 Dorian F… PF       28 DAL      80  2644  12.5 0.604  0.629 0.12     5.1\n# … with 802 more rows, and 17 more variables: `DRB%` <dbl>, `TRB%` <dbl>,\n#   `AST%` <dbl>, `STL%` <dbl>, `BLK%` <dbl>, `TOV%` <dbl>, `USG%` <dbl>,\n#   ...20 <lgl>, OWS <dbl>, DWS <dbl>, WS <dbl>, `WS/48` <dbl>, ...25 <lgl>,\n#   OBPM <dbl>, DBPM <dbl>, BPM <dbl>, VORP <dbl>\n\n\nThe player with the most minutes on the floor is a small forward. So that means there’s Mikal Bridges rolling up 2,854 minutes in a season, and then there’s Boston sensation Justin Jackson. Never heard of Justin Jackson? Might be because he logged two minutes in one game this season.\nThat’s a huge difference.\nSo when choosing a measure of the middle, you have to ask yourself – could I have extremes? Because a median won’t be sensitive to extremes. It will be the point at which half the numbers are above and half are below. The average or mean will be a measure of the middle, but if you have a bunch of pine riders and then one ironman superstar, the average will be wildly skewed."

And what is the highest and lowest minute total for that position? And how wide is the spread between minutes? We can find that with sum to add up the minutes to get the total minutes, min to find the minimum minutes, max to find the maximum minutes and sd to find the standard deviation in the numbers.\n\nnbaplayers %>% \n  group_by(Pos) %>% \n  summarise(\n    total = sum(MP), \n    avgminutes = mean(MP), \n    minminutes = min(MP),\n    maxminutes = max(MP),\n    stdev = sd(MP)) %>% arrange(desc(total))\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 6\n   Pos    total avgminutes minminutes maxminutes stdev\n   <chr>  <dbl>      <dbl>      <dbl>      <dbl> <dbl>\n 1 SG    163361       821.          1       2499  766.\n 2 PF    127917       842.          1       2837  793.\n 3 PG    127159       815.          1       2678  801.\n 4 SF    121695       775.          2       2854  779.\n 5 C     108505       835.          2       2476  721.\n 6 SG-PG   5401      1350.         25       2695 1163.\n 7 SF-SG   5371      1074.        212       2057  709.\n 8 SG-SF   3272       654.        104       1791  697.\n 9 C-PF    3013      1506.        877       2136  890.\n10 PG-SG   2419      2419        2419       2419   NA \n11 PF-SF   1940      1940        1940       1940   NA \n\n\nSo again, no surprise, shooting guards spend the most minutes on the floor in the NBA. They average 820 minutes, but we noted why that’s trouble. The minimum is a one-minute wonder, max is some team failing at load management, and the standard deviation is a measure of how spread out the data is. In this case, not the highest spread among positions, but pretty high. So you know you’ve got some huge minutes players and a bunch of bench players."

    "text": "One of the most common data analysis techniques is to look at change over time. The most common way of comparing change over time is through percent change. The math behind calculating percent change is very simple, and you should know it off the top of your head. The easy way to remember it is:\n(new - old) / old\nOr new minus old divided by old. Your new number minus the old number, the result of which is divided by the old number. To do that in R, we can use dplyr and mutate to calculate new metrics in a new field using existing fields of data.\nSo first we’ll import the tidyverse so we can read in our data and begin to work with it.\nNow you’ll need a common and simple dataset of total attendance at NCAA football games over the last few seasons.\nYou’ll import it something like this.\nIf you want to see the first six rows – handy to take a peek at your data – you can use the function head.\nThe code to calculate percent change is pretty simple. Remember, with summarize, we used n() to count things. With mutate, we use very similar syntax to calculate a new value using other values in our dataset. So in this case, we’re trying to do (new-old)/old, but we’re doing it with fields. If we look at what we got when we did head, you’ll see there’s `2019` as the new data, and we’ll use `2018` as the old data. So we’re looking at one year. Then, to help us, we’ll use arrange again to sort it, so we get the fastest growing school over one year.\nWhat do we see right away? Do those numbers look like we expect them to? No. They’re a decimal expressed as a percentage. So let’s fix that by multiplying by 100.\nNow, does this ordering do anything for us? No. Let’s fix that with arrange.\nSo who had the most growth in 2019 compared to the year before? Kansas."

    "text": "5.1 A more complex example\nThere’s metric in basketball that’s easy to understand – shooting percentage. It’s the number of shots made divided by the number of shots attempted. Simple, right? Except it’s a little too simple. Because what about three point shooters? They tend to be more vailable because the three point shot is worth more. What about players who get to the line? In shooting percentage, free throws are nowhere to be found.\nBasketball nerds, because of these weaknesses, have created a new metric called True Shooting Percentage. True shooting percentage takes into account all aspects of a players shooting to determine who the real shooters are.\nUsing dplyr and mutate, we can calculate true shooting percentage. So let’s look at a new dataset, one of every college basketball player’s season stats in 2021-22 season. It’s a dataset of 5,688 players, and we’ve got 59 variables – one of them is True Shooting Percentage, but we’re going to ignore that.\nFor this walkthrough:\n   Download csv file\n\nImport it like this:\n\nplayers <- read_csv(\"data/players22.csv\")\n\nRows: 5688 Columns: 59\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (10): Team, Player, Class, Pos, Height, Hometown, High School, Summary, ...\ndbl (49): #, Weight, Rk.x, G, GS, MP, FG, FGA, FG%, 2P, 2PA, 2P%, 3P, 3PA, 3...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThe basic true shooting percentage formula is (Points / (2*(FieldGoalAttempts + (.44 * FreeThrowAttempts)))) * 100. Let’s talk that through. Points divided by a lot. It’s really field goal attempts plus 44 percent of the free throw attempts. Why? Because that’s about what a free throw is worth, compared to other ways to score. After adding those things together, you double it. And after you divide points by that number, you multiply the whole lot by 100.\nIn our data, we need to be able to find the fields so we can complete the formula. To do that, one way is to use the Environment tab in R Studio. In the Environment tab is a listing of all the data you’ve imported, and if you click the triangle next to it, it’ll list all the field names, giving you a bit of information about each one.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does True Shooting Percentage look like in code?\nLet’s think about this differently. Who had the best true shooting season last year?\n\nplayers %>%\n  mutate(trueshooting = (PTS/(2*(FGA + (.44*FTA))))*100) %>%\n  arrange(desc(trueshooting))\n\n# A tibble: 5,688 × 60\n   Team     Player   `#` Class Pos   Height Weight Homet…¹ High …² Summary  Rk.x\n   <chr>    <chr>  <dbl> <chr> <chr> <chr>   <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>   <dbl>\n 1 Washing… Noah …    32 JR    G     6-3       185 Seattl… Garfie… 0.6 Pt…    13\n 2 Troy Tr… DJ Ro…    34 FR    G     6-1       160 Monroe… Oakman… 1.0 Pt…    17\n 3 Syracus… Arthu…    33 SO    G     6-3       185 Wallin… Sheeha… 0.8 Pt…    13\n 4 Stony B… Prest…    12 <NA>  G     6-4       205 Syracu… Jamesv… 3.0 Pt…    14\n 5 USC Tro… Amar …    55 SR    G     5-7       150 Long B… Fremon… 3.0 Pt…    13\n 6 South C… Ford …    44 JR    G     6-3       183 Charlo… United… 3.0 Pt…    16\n 7 UNC Gre… Jevon…    15 <NA>  G     6-3       170 Durham… <NA>    1.0 Pt…    13\n 8 New Mex… Safi …     2 <NA>  G     5-11      165 Las Cr… <NA>    3.0 Pt…    15\n 9 New Mex… Camer…    20 <NA>  G     6-1       165 Kirtla… Kirtla… 0.8 Pt…    15\n10 Mercer … John …    15 SO    F     6-6       210 Atlant… Marist… 1.5 Pt…    14\n# … with 5,678 more rows, 49 more variables: G <dbl>, GS <dbl>, MP <dbl>,\n#   FG <dbl>, FGA <dbl>, `FG%` <dbl>, `2P` <dbl>, `2PA` <dbl>, `2P%` <dbl>,\n#   `3P` <dbl>, `3PA` <dbl>, `3P%` <dbl>, FT <dbl>, FTA <dbl>, `FT%` <dbl>,\n#   ORB <dbl>, DRB <dbl>, TRB <dbl>, AST <dbl>, STL <dbl>, BLK <dbl>,\n#   TOV <dbl>, PF <dbl>, PTS <dbl>, Rk.y <dbl>, PER <dbl>, `TS%` <dbl>,\n#   `eFG%` <dbl>, `3PAr` <dbl>, FTr <dbl>, PProd <dbl>, `ORB%` <dbl>,\n#   `DRB%` <dbl>, `TRB%` <dbl>, `AST%` <dbl>, `STL%` <dbl>, `BLK%` <dbl>, …\n\n\nYou’ll be forgiven if you did not hear about USC’s shooting sensation Amar Ross.

Does that mean he had the best true shooting season in college basketball in the 2021-22 season?\nNot hardly.\nWe’ll talk about how to narrow the pile and filter out data in the next chapter."

    "text": "More often than not, we have more data than we want. Sometimes we need to be rid of that data. In dplyr, there’s two ways to go about this: filtering and selecting.\nFiltering creates a subset of the data based on criteria. All records where the count is greater than 10. All records that match “Maryland”. Something like that.\nSelecting simply returns only the fields named. So if you only want to see School and Attendance, you select those fields. When you look at your data again, you’ll have two columns. If you try to use one of your columns that you had before you used select, you’ll get an error.\nLet’s work with our football attendance data to show some examples.\nFirst we’ll need the tidyverse.\nNow import the data.\nSo, first things first, let’s say we don’t care about all this Air Force, Akron, Alabama crap and just want to see Dear Old Maryland We do that with filter and then we pass it a condition.\nBefore we do that, a note about conditions. Most of the conditional operators you’ll understand – greater than and less than are > and <. The tough one to remember is equal to. In conditional statements, equal to is == not =. If you haven’t noticed, = is a variable assignment operator, not a conditional statement. So equal is == and NOT equal is !=.\nSo if you want to see Institutions equal to Maryland, you do this:\nOr if we want to see schools that had more than half a million people buy tickets to a football game in a season, we do the following. NOTE THE BACKTICKS.\nBut what if we want to see all of the Power Five conferences? We could use conditional logic in our filter. The conditional logic operators are | for OR and & for AND. NOTE: AND means all conditions have to be met. OR means any of the conditions work. So be careful about boolean logic.\nBut that’s a lot of repetitive code. And a lot of typing. And typing is the devil. So what if we could create a list and pass it into the filter? It’s pretty simple.\nWe can create a new variable – remember variables can represent just about anything – and create a list. To do that we use the c operator, which stands for concatenate. That just means take all the stuff in the parenthesis after the c and bunch it into a list.\nNote here: text is in quotes. If they were numbers, we wouldn’t need the quotes.\nNow with a list, we can use the %in% operator. It does what you think it does – it gives you data that matches things IN the list you give it."

We’re filtering by our list of Power Five conferences, we’re selecting the three fields we need, now we’re going to arrange it by total attendance and then we’ll introduce the new function: top_n. The top_n function just takes a number. So we want a top 10 list? We do it like this:\n\nattendance %>% filter(Conference %in% powerfive) %>% select(Institution, Conference, `2019`) %>% arrange(desc(`2019`)) %>% top_n(10)\n\nSelecting by 2019\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   Institution Conference `2019`\n   <chr>       <chr>       <dbl>\n 1 Michigan    Big Ten    780215\n 2 Penn St.    Big Ten    739747\n 3 Ohio St.    Big Ten    723679\n 4 Texas A&M   SEC        711258\n 5 Alabama     SEC        707817\n 6 LSU         SEC        705892\n 7 Tennessee   SEC        702912\n 8 Georgia     SEC        649722\n 9 Nebraska    Big Ten    625436\n10 Auburn      SEC        600355\n\n\nThat’s all there is to it.

    "text": "Sometimes long data needs to be wide, and sometimes wide data needs to be long. I’ll explain.\nYou are soon going to discover that long before you can visualize data, you need to have it in a form that the visualization library can deal with. One of the ways that isn’t immediately obvious is how your data is cast. Most of the data you will encounter will be wide – each row will represent a single entity with multiple measures for that entity. So think of states. Your row of your dataset could have the state name, population, average life expectancy and other demographic data.\nBut what if your visualization library needs one row for each measure? So state, data type and the data. Maryland, Population, 6,177,224. That’s one row. Then the next row is Maryland, Average Life Expectancy, 78.5 That’s the next row. That’s where recasting your data comes in.\nWe can use a library called tidyr to pivot_longer or pivot_wider the data, depending on what we need. We’ll use a dataset of college football attendance to demonstrate.\nFirst we need some libraries.\nNow we’ll load the data.\nSo as you can see, each row represents a school, and then each column represents a year. This is great for calculating the percent change – we can subtract a column from a column and divide by that column. But later, when we want to chart each school’s attendance over the years, we have to have each row be one team for one year. Maryland in 2013, then Maryland in 2014, and Maryland in 2015 and so on.\nTo do that, we use pivot_longer because we’re making wide data long. Since all of the columns we want to make rows start with 20, we can use that in our cols directive. Then we give that column a name – Year – and the values for each year need a name too. Those are the attendance figure. We can see right away how this works.\nWe’ve gone from 149 rows to more than 1,000, but that’s expected when we have 7 years for each team."

    "text": "Now that we’ve worked with data a little, it’s time to start asking more probing questions of our data. One of the most probing questions we can ask – one that so few sports journalists ask – is if the difference between this thing and the normal thing is real.\nWe have a perfect natural experiment going on in sports right now to show how significance tests work. The NBA, to salvage a season and get to the playoffs, put their players in a bubble – more accurately a hotel complex at Disney World in Orlando – and had them play games without fans.\nSo are the games different from other regular season games that had fans?\nTo answer this, we need to understand that a significance test is a way to determine if two numbers are significantly different from each other. Generally speaking, we’re asking if a subset of data – a sample – is different from the total data pool – the population. Typically, this relies on data being in a normal distribution.\nIf it is, then we know certain things about it. Like the mean – the average – will be a line right at the peak of cases. And that 66 percent of cases will be in that red area – the first standard deviation.\nA significance test will determine if a sample taken from that group is different from the total.\nSignificance testing involves stating a hypothesis. In our case, our hypothesis is that there is a difference between bubble games without people and regular games with people.\nIn statistics, the null hypothesis is the opposite of your hypothesis. In this case, that there is no difference between fans and no fans.\nWhat we’re driving toward is a metric called a p-value, which is the probability that you’d get your sample mean if the null hypothesis is true. So in our case, it’s the probability we’d see the numbers we get if there was no difference between fans and no fans. If that probability is below .05, then we consider the difference significant and we reject the null hypothesis.\nSo let’s see. We’ll need a log of every game last NBA season. In this data, there’s a field called COVID, which labels the game as a regular game or a bubble game.\nLoad the tidyverse.\nAnd import the data.\nFirst, let’s just look at scoring. Here’s a theory: fans make players nervous. The screaming makes players tense up, and tension makes for bad shooting. An alternative to this: screaming fans make you defend harder. So my hypothesis is that not only is the scoring different, it’s lower.\nFirst things first, let’s create a new field, called totalpoints and add the two scores together. We’ll need this, so we’re going to make this a new dataframe called points.\nTypically speaking, with significance tests, the process involves creating two different means and then running a bunch of formulas on them. R makes this easy by giving you a t.test function, which does all the work for you. What we have to tell it is what is the value we are testing, over which groups, and from what data. It looks like this:\nNow let’s talk about the output. I prefer to read these bottom up. So at the bottom, it says that the mean number of points score in an NBA game With Fans is 222.89. The mean scored in games Without Fans is 231.35. That means teams are scoring almost 8.5 points MORE without fans on average.\nBut, some games are defenseless track meets, some games are defensive slugfests. We learned that averages can be skewed by extremes. So the next thing we need to look at is the p-value. Remember, this is the probability that we’d get this sample mean – the without fans mean – if there was no difference between fans and no fans.\nThe probability? 4.099e-07 or 4.099 x 10 to the -7 power. Don’t remember your scientific notation? That’s .00000004099. The decimal, seven zeros and the number.\nRemember, if the probability is below .05, then we determine that this number is statistically significant. We’ll talk more about statistical significance soon, but in this case, statistical significance means that our hypothesis is correct: points are different without fans than with. And since our hypothesis is correct, we reject the null hypothesis and we can confidently say that bubble teams are scoring more than they were when fans packed arenas."

    "text": "8.1 Accepting the null hypothesis\nSo what does it look like when your hypothesis is wrong?\nLet’s test another thing that may have been impacted by bubble games: home court advantage. If you’re the home team, but you’re not at home, does it affect you? It has to, right? Your fans aren’t there. Home and away are just positions on the scoreboard. It can’t matter, can it?\nMy hypothesis is that home court is no longer an advantage, and the home team will score less relative to the away team.\nFirst things first: We need to make a dataframe where Team is the home team. And then we’ll create a differential between the home team and away team. If home court is an advantage, the differential should average out to be positive – the home team scores more than the away team.\n\nhomecourt <- logs %>% filter(is.na(HomeAway) == TRUE) %>% mutate(differential = TeamScore - OpponentScore)\n\nNow let’s test it.\n\nt.test(differential ~ COVID, data=homecourt)\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  differential by COVID\nt = 0.36892, df = 107.84, p-value = 0.7129\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group With Fans and group Without Fans is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -2.301628  3.354268\nsample estimates:\n   mean in group With Fans mean in group Without Fans \n                  2.174047                   1.647727 \n\n\nSo again, start at the bottom. With Fans, the home team averages 2.17 more points than the away team. Without fans, they average 1.64 more.\nIf you are a bad sportswriter or a hack sports talk radio host, you look at this and scream “the bubble killed home court!”\nBut two things: first, the home team is STILL, on average, scoring more than the away team on the whole.\nAnd two: Look at the p-value. It’s .7129. Is that less than .05? No, no it is not. So that means we have to accept the null hypothesis that there is no difference between fans and no fans when it comes to the difference between the home team and the away team’s score.\nNow, does this mean that the bubble hasn’t impacted the magic of home court? Not necessarily. What it’s saying is that the variance between one and the other is too large to be able to say that they’re different. It could just be random noise that’s causing the difference, and so it’s not real. More to the point, it’s saying that this metric isn’t capable of telling you that there’s no home court in the bubble.\nWe’re going to be analyzing these bubble games for years trying to find the true impact of fans."

    "text": "Throughout sports, you will find no shortage of opinions. From people yelling at their TV screens to an entire industry of people paid to have opinions, there are no shortage of reasons why this team sucks and that player is great. They may have their reasons, but a better question is, does that reason really matter?\nCan we put some numbers behind that? Can we prove it or not?\nThis is what we’re going to start to answer. And we’ll do it with correlations and regressions.\nFirst, we need data from the 2021 college football season.\nThen load the tidyverse.\nNow import the data.\nTo do this, we need all FBS college football teams and their season stats from last year. How much, over the course of a season, does a thing matter? That’s the question you’re going to answer.\nIn our case, we want to know how much does a team’s accumulated penalties influence the number of points they score in a season? How much difference can we explain in points with penalties?\nWe’re going to use two different methods here and they’re closely related. Correlations – specifically the Pearson Correlation Coefficient – is a measure of how related two numbers are in a linear fashion. In other words – if our X value goes up one, what happens to Y? If it also goes up 1, that’s a perfect correlation. X goes up 1, Y goes up 1. Every time. Correlation coefficients are a number between 0 and 1, with zero being no correlation and 1 being perfect correlation if our data is linear. We’ll soon go over scatterplots to visually determine if our data is linear, but for now, we have a hypothesis: More penalties are bad. Penalties hurt. So if a team gets lots of them, they should have worse outcomes than teams that get few of them. That is an argument for a linear relationship between them.\nBut is there one?\nWe’re going create a new dataframe called newcorrelations that takes our data that we imported and adds a column called differential because we don’t have separate offense and defense penalties, and then we’ll use correlations to see how related those two things are.\nIn R, there is a cor function, and it works much the same as mean or median. So we want to see if differential is correlated with TotalPenaltyYards, which is the yards of penalties a team gets in a game. We do that by referencing differential and TotalPenaltyYards and specifying we want a pearson correlation. The number we get back is the correlation coefficient.\nSo on a scale of -1 to 1, where 0 means there’s no relationship at all and 1 or -1 means a perfect relationship, penalty yards and whether or not the team scores more points than it give up are at -0.01566025 You could say they’re 1.5 percent related toward the negative – more penalties, the lower your differential. Another way to say it? They’re 98.5 percent not related.\nWhat about the number of penalties instead of the yards?\nSo wait, what does this all mean?\nIt means that when you look at every game in college football, the number of penalties and penalty yards does have a negative impact on the score difference between your team and the other team. But the relationship between penalties, penalty yards and the difference between scores is barely anything at all. Like 98+ percent plus not related.\nNormally, at this point, you’d quit while you were ahead. A correlation coefficient that shows there’s no relationship between two things means stop. It’s pointless to go on. But let’s beat a dead horse a bit for the sake of talk radio callers who want to complain about undisciplined football teams.\nEnter regression. Regression is how we try to fit our data into a line that explains the relationship the best. Regressions will help us predict things as well – if we have a team that has so many penalties, what kind of point differential could we expect? So regressions are about prediction, correlations are about description. Correlations describe a relationship. Regressions help us predict what that relationship means and what it might look like in the real world. Specifically, it tells us how much of the change in a dependent variable can be explained by the independent variable.\nAnother thing regressions do is give us some other tools to evaluate if the relationship is real or not.\nHere’s an example of using linear modeling to look at penalty yards. Think of the ~ character as saying “is predicted by”. The output looks like a lot, but what we need is a small part of it.\nThere’s three things we need here:\nSo penalty yards are totally meaningless to the outcome of a game.\nYou can see the problem in a graph. On the X axis is penalty yards, on the y is aggregate score. If these elements had a strong relationship, we’d see a clear pattern moving from right to left, sloping down. On the left would be the teams with few penalties and a positive point differential. On right would be teams with high penalty yards and negative point differentials. Do you see that below?"

See that e-16? That means scientific notation. That means our number is 2.2 times 10 to the -16 power. So -.000000000000000022. That’s sixteen zeros between the decimal and 22. Is that less than .05? Uh, yeah. So this is really, really, really not random. But anyone who has watched a game of football knows this is true. It makes intuitive sense.\nSecond, Adjusted R-squared: 0.6921. So we can predict a whopping 69 percent of the difference in the score differential by simply looking at the net yards the team has.\nThird, the coefficients: In this case, our y=mx+b formula looks like y = 0.107464x + 0.428075. So if we were applying this, let’s look at Nebraska’s 26-20 loss to Iowa in 2020. Nebraska’s net yards that game? 16. That’s right – positive net yards, but still a loss. What does our model say the point differential should have been?\n\n(0.107464*16)+0.428075 \n\n[1] 2.147499\n\n\nSo by our model, Nebraska should have won by 2.14 points. Some games are closer than others. But when you can explain 69 percent of the difference, this is the kind of result you get. What would improve the model? Using more data to start. And using more inputs."

    "text": "That presents it’s own problems. So let’s get set up. The dataset we’ll use is all college football games between 2011 and 2021.\nFor this walkthrough:\n   Download csv file\n\nWe need the tidyverse.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nAnd the data.\n\nlogs <- read_csv(\"data/footballlogs1121.csv\")\n\nRows: 17292 Columns: 55\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (8): HomeAway, Opponent, Result, TeamFull, TeamURL, Outcome, Team, Con...\ndbl  (46): Game, PassingCmp, PassingAtt, PassingPct, PassingYds, PassingTD, ...\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nOne way to show how successful a footballl team was for a game is to show the differential between the team’s score and the opponent’s score. Score a lot more than the opponent = good, score a lot less than the opponent = bad. And, relatively speaking, the more the better. So let’s create that differential. Let’s also get our net yardage stat back. And because we’ll need it later, let’s add the turnover margin.\n\nlogs <- logs %>% mutate(\n  Differential = TeamScore - OpponentScore, \n  NetYards = OffensiveYards - DefYards, \n  TurnoverMargin = DefTotalTurnovers - TotalTurnovers)\n\nThe linear model code we used before is pretty straight forward. Its field is predicted by field. Here’s a simple linear model that looks at predicting a team’s point differential by looking at their net yards.\n\nyards <- lm(Differential ~ NetYards, data=logs)\nsummary(yards)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Differential ~ NetYards, data = logs)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-52.107  -8.719   0.008   8.740  64.517 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n(Intercept) 0.4860213  0.0995105   4.884 1.05e-06 ***\nNetYards    0.1048648  0.0005579 187.950  < 2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 13.05 on 17290 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.6714,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.6714 \nF-statistic: 3.533e+04 on 1 and 17290 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\n\nRemember: There’s a lot here, but only some of it we care about. What is the Adjusted R-squared value? What’s the p-value and is it less than .05? In this case, we can predict 67 percent of the difference in differential with the net yardage in the game.\nTo add more predictors to this mix, we merely add them. But it’s not that simple, as you’ll see in a moment. So first, let’s look at adding how well the other team shot to our prediction model:\n\nmodel1 <- lm(Differential ~ NetYards + TurnoverMargin, data=logs)\nsummary(model1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Differential ~ NetYards + TurnoverMargin, data = logs)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-40.235  -7.027  -0.013   6.979  40.690 \n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n(Intercept)    0.4575074  0.0804069    5.69 1.29e-08 ***\nNetYards       0.0968307  0.0004585  211.17  < 2e-16 ***\nTurnoverMargin 4.1683996  0.0434749   95.88  < 2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 10.55 on 17289 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.7855,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.7854 \nF-statistic: 3.165e+04 on 2 and 17289 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\n\nFirst things first: What is the adjusted R-squared?\nSecond: what is the p-value and is it less than .05?\nThird: Compare the residual standard error. We went from 13.05 to 10.55. The meaning of this is both really opaque and also simple – by adding data, we reduced the amount of error in our model. Residual standard error is the total distance between what our model would predict and what we actually have in the data. So lots of residual error means the distance between reality and our model is wider. So the width of our predictive range in this example shrank while we improved the amount of the difference we could predict. That’s good, and not always going to be the case.\nOne of the more difficult things to understand about multiple regression is the issue of multicollinearity. What that means is that there is significant correlation overlap between two variables – the two are related to each other as well as to the target output – and all you are doing by adding both of them is adding error with no real value to the R-squared. In pure statistics, we don’t want any multicollinearity at all. Violating that assumption limits the applicability of what you are doing. So if we have some multicollinearity, it limits our scope of application to college football We can’t say this will work for every football league and level everywhere. What we need to do is see how correlated each value is to each other and throw out ones that are highly co-correlated.\nSo to find those, we have to create a correlation matrix that shows us how each value is correlated to our outcome variable, but also with each other. We can do that in the Hmisc library. We install that in the console with install.packages(\"Hmisc\")\n\nlibrary(Hmisc)\n\nWe can pass in every numeric value to the Hmisc library and get a correlation matrix out of it, but since we have a large number of values – and many of them character values – we should strip that down and reorder them. So that’s what I’m doing here. I’m saying give me differential first, and then columns 9-24, and then 26-41. Why the skip? There’s a blank column in the middle of the data – a remnant of the scraper I used.\n\nsimplelogs <- logs %>% select_if(is.numeric) %>% select(-Game) %>% select(Differential, NetYards, TurnoverMargin, everything())\n\nBefore we proceed, what we’re looking to do is follow the Differential column down, looking for correlation values near 1 or -1. Correlations go from -1, meaning perfect negative correlation, to 0, meaning no correlation, to 1, meaning perfect positive correlation. So we’re looking for numbers near 1 or -1 for their predictive value. BUT: We then need to see if that value is also highly correlated with something else. If it is, we have a decision to make.\nWe get our correlation matrix like this:\n\ncormatrix <- rcorr(as.matrix(simplelogs))\n\ncormatrix$r\n\n                  Differential      NetYards

But NetYards’s also highly correlated with RushingYards, OffensiveYards and DefYards. And that makes sense: those things all feed into NetYards. Including all of these measures would be pointless – they would add error without adding much in the way of predictive power.\n\nYour turn: What else do you see? What other values have predictive power and aren’t co-correlated?\n\nWe can add more just by simply adding them. Let’s add the average yard per play for both offense and defense.

What is the p-value and is it less than .05? What is the Residual standard error?\nThe final thing we can do with this is predict things. Look at our coefficients table. See the Estimates? We can build a formula from that, same as we did with linear regressions.\nHow does this apply in the real world? Let’s pretend for a minute that you are Mike Locksley, and you have a mess on your hands. Your job is to win conference titles. To do that, we need to know what attributes of a team should we emphasize. We can do that by looking at what previous Big Ten conference champions looked like.\nSo if our goal is to predict a conference champion team, we need to know what those teams did. Here’s the regular season conference champions in this dataset.\n\nlogs %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Ohio State\" & Season == 2021 | Team == \"Ohio State\" & Season == 2020 | Team == \"Ohio State\" & Season == 2019 | Team == \"Ohio State\" & Season == 2018) %>% \n  summarise(\n    meanNetYards = mean(NetYards),\n    meanTurnoverMargin = mean(TurnoverMargin),\n    meanDefAvg = mean(DefAvg),\n    meanOffenseAvg = mean(OffenseAvg)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  meanNetYards meanTurnoverMargin meanDefAvg meanOffenseAvg\n         <dbl>              <dbl>      <dbl>          <dbl>\n1         194.              0.688       5.15           7.28\n\n\nNow it’s just plug and chug.\n\n(0.0551813*193.5833 ) + (3.8548574*0.6875) + (-3.8991399*5.145833   ) + (3.8612863*7.28125) + 0.5826970\n\n[1] 21.96576\n\n\nSo a team with those numbers is going to average scoring 21 more points per game than their opponent. Sound like Ohio State in the last three years?\nHow does that compare to Maryland for last season?\n\nlogs %>% \n  filter(\n    Team == \"Maryland\" & Season == 2021\n    ) %>% \n  summarise(\n    meanNetYards = mean(NetYards),\n    meanTurnoverMargin = mean(TurnoverMargin),\n    meanDefAvg = mean(DefAvg),\n    meanOffenseAvg = mean(OffenseAvg)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  meanNetYards meanTurnoverMargin meanDefAvg meanOffenseAvg\n         <dbl>              <dbl>      <dbl>          <dbl>\n1         39.3             -0.538       5.67           6.24\n\n\n\n(0.0551813*39.30769 ) + (3.8548574*-0.5384615) + (-3.8991399*.669231    ) + (3.8612863*6.238462) + 0.5826970\n\n[1] 22.15512\n\n\nBy this model, it predicted we would average outscoring our opponents by 22 points over the season! The reality? We were outscored by 8.4 on average."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When looking at a linear model of your data, there’s a measure you need to be aware of called residuals. The residual is the distance between what the model predicted and what the real outcome is. Take our model at the end of the correlation and regression chapter. Our model predicted Maryland, given a -20 net yardage margin would lose to Indiana by 2.2 points. They lost by 16. So our residual is -13.8.\nResiduals can tell you several things, but most important is if a linear model the right model for your data. If the residuals appear to be random, then a linear model is appropriate. If they have a pattern, it means something else is going on in your data and a linear model isn’t appropriate.\nResiduals can also tell you who is underperforming and overperforming the model. And the more robust the model – the better your r-squared value is – the more meaningful that label of under or overperforming is.\nLet’s go back to our net yards model.\nThen load the tidyverse.\nFirst, let’s make the columns we’ll need.\nNow let’s create our model.\nWe’ve seen this output before, but let’s review because if you are using scatterplots to make a point, you should do this. First, note the Min and Max residual at the top. A team has underperformed the model by 36 points (!), and a team has overperformed it by 35 points (!!). The median residual, where half are above and half are below, is just slightly above the fit line. Close here is good.\nNext: Look at the Adjusted R-squared value. What that says is that 69 percent of a team’s scoring output can be predicted by their net yards.\nLast: Look at the p-value. We are looking for a p-value smaller than .05. At .05, we can say that our correlation didn’t happen at random. And, in this case, it REALLY didn’t happen at random. But if you know a little bit about football, it doesn’t surprise you that the more you outgain your opponent, the more you win by. It’s an intuitive result.\nWhat we want to do now is look at those residuals. We want to add them to our individual game records. We can do that by creating two new fields – predicted and residuals – to our dataframe like this:\nNow we can sort our data by those residuals. Sorting in descending order gives us the games where teams overperformed the model. To make it easier to read, I’m going to use select to give us just the columns we need to see.\nSo looking at this table, what you see here are the teams who scored more than their net yards would indicate. One of them should jump off the page at you.\nLook at that Notre Dame-Wisconsin game. Not only did the Badgers outgain the Irish, but the model predicted they would win by a touchdown. Instead, Notre Dame won by 28!\nBut, before we can bestow any validity on this model, we need to see if this linear model is appropriate. We’ve done that some looking at our p-values and R-squared values. But one more check is to look at the residuals themselves. We do that by plotting the residuals with the predictor. We’ll get into plotting soon, but for now just seeing it is enough.\nThe lack of a shape here – the seemingly random nature – is a good sign that a linear model works for our data. If there was a pattern, that would indicate something else was going on in our data and we needed a different model.\nAnother way to view your residuals is by connecting the predicted value with the actual value.\nThe blue line here separates underperformers from overperformers."

In other words, this model is terrible. But let’s look at it anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell … it actually says that a linear model is appropriate. Which an important lesson – just because your residual plot says a linear model works here, that doesn’t say your linear model is good. There are other measures for that, and you need to use them.\nHere’s the segment plot of residuals – you’ll see some really long lines. That’s a bad sign. Another bad sign? A flat fit line.

    "text": "Z-scores are a handy way to standardize numbers so you can compare things across groupings or time. In this class, we may want to compare teams by year, or era. We can use z-scores to answer questions like who was the greatest X of all time, because a z-score can put them in context to their era.\nA z-score is a measure of how a particular stat is from the mean. It’s measured in standard deviations from that mean. A standard deviation is a measure of how much variation – how spread out – numbers are in a data set. What it means here, with regards to z-scores, is that zero is perfectly average. If it’s 1, it’s one standard deviation above the mean, and 34 percent of all cases are between 0 and 1.\nIf you think of the normal distribution, it means that 84.3 percent of all case are below that 1. If it were -1, it would mean the number is one standard deviation below the mean, and 84.3 percent of cases would be above that -1. So if you have numbers with z-scores of 3 or even 4, that means that number is waaaaaay above the mean.\nSo let’s use last year’s Maryland women’s basketball team, which if haven’t been paying attention to current events, was very talented but had a few struggles."

So I’m going to pick shooting percentage, rebounding and the opponent version of the same two:\n\nteamquality <- gamelogs %>% \n  select(conference, team, fg_pct, trb, opp_fg_pct, opp_trb)\n\nAnd since we have individual game data, we need to collapse this into one record for each team. We do that with … group by.\n\nteamtotals <- teamquality %>% \n  group_by(conference, team) %>% \n  summarise(\n    FGAvg = mean(fg_pct), \n    ReboundAvg = mean(trb), \n    OppFGAvg = mean(opp_fg_pct),\n    OffRebAvg = mean(opp_trb)\n    ) \n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'conference'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nTo calculate a z-score in R, the easiest way is to use the scale function in base R. To use it, you use scale(FieldName, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE). The center and scale indicate if you want to subtract from the mean and if you want to divide by the standard deviation, respectively. We do.\nWhen we have multiple z-scores, it’s pretty standard practice to add them together into a composite score. That’s what we’re doing at the end here with TotalZscore. Note: We have to invert OppZscore and OppRebZScore by multiplying it by a negative 1 because the lower someone’s opponent number is, the better.\n\nteamzscore <- teamtotals %>% \n  mutate(\n    FGzscore = as.numeric(scale(FGAvg, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    RebZscore = as.numeric(scale(ReboundAvg, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),\n    OppZscore = as.numeric(scale(OppFGAvg, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)) * -1,\n    OppRebZScore = as.numeric(scale(OffRebAvg, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)) * -1,\n    TotalZscore = FGzscore + RebZscore + OppZscore + OppRebZScore\n  )  \n\nSo now we have a dataframe called teamzscore that has 1,317 basketball teams with Z scores. What does it look like?\n\nhead(teamzscore)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n# Groups:   conference [1]\n  conference team  FGAvg Rebou…¹ OppFG…² OffRe…³ FGzsc…⁴ RebZs…⁵ OppZs…⁶ OppRe…⁷\n  <chr>      <chr> <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 AAC        Cinc… 0.374    35.4   0.388    41.0 -0.981   -1.17   -0.445 -1.55  \n2 AAC        East… 0.364    37.8   0.381    38.8 -1.58    -0.293  -0.100 -0.724 \n3 AAC        Hous… 0.389    37.3   0.396    36.7 -0.105   -0.475  -0.839  0.0627\n4 AAC        Memp… 0.392    39.3   0.392    34.5  0.0931   0.235  -0.648  0.874 \n5 AAC        SMU   0.383    39.0   0.374    38.5 -0.450    0.110   0.246 -0.620 \n6 AAC        Sout… 0.385    40.1   0.367    32.9 -0.365    0.518   0.579  1.47  \n# … with 1 more variable: TotalZscore <dbl>, and abbreviated variable names\n#   ¹​ReboundAvg, ²​OppFGAvg, ³​OffRebAvg, ⁴​FGzscore, ⁵​RebZscore, ⁶​OppZscore,\n#   ⁷​OppRebZScore\n\n\nA way to read this – a team with a TotalZScore of 0 is precisely average.

    "text": "12.2 Writing about z-scores\nThe great thing about z-scores is that they make it very easy for you, the sports analyst, to create your own measures of who is better than who. The downside: Only a small handful of sports fans know what the hell a z-score is.\nAs such, you should try as hard as you can to avoid writing about them.\nIf the word z-score appears in your story or in a chart, you need to explain what it is. “The ranking uses a statistical measure of the distance from the mean called a z-score” is a good way to go about it. You don’t need a full stats textbook definition, just a quick explanation. And keep it simple.\nNever use z-score in a headline. Write around it. Away from it. Z-score in a headline is attention repellent. You won’t get anyone to look at it. So “Tottenham tops in z-score” bad, “Tottenham tops in the Premiere League” good."

    "title": "13  Clustering",
    "section": "",
    "text": "One common effort in sports is to classify teams and players – who are this players peers? What teams are like this one? Who should we compare a player to? Truth is, most sports commentators use nothing more sophisticated that looking at a couple of stats or use the “eye test” to say a player is like this or that.\nThere’s better ways.\nIn this chapter, we’re going to use a method that sounds advanced but it really quite simple called k-means clustering. It’s based on the concept of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm. You’re probably already scared. Don’t be.\nImagine two dots on a scatterplot. If you took a ruler out and measured the distance between those dots, you’d know how far apart they are. In math, that’s called the Euclidean distance. It’s just the space between them in numbers. Where k-nearest neighbor comes in, you have lots of dots and you want measure the distance between all of them. What does k-means clustering do? It lumps them into groups based on the average distance between them. Players who are good on offense but bad on defense are over here, good offense good defense are over here. And using the Euclidean distance between them, we can decide who is in and who is out of those groups.\nFor this exercise, I want to look at Jalen Smith, who played two seasons at Maryland before decamping for the NBA. Had he stayed, he could have been among the all-time Terp greats. So who does Jalen Smith compare to?\nTo answer this, we’ll use k-means clustering.\nFirst thing we do is load some libraries and set a seed, so if we run this repeatedly, our random numbers are generated from the same base. If you don’t have the cluster library, just add it on the console with install.packages(\"cluster\")\nI’ve gone and scraped stats for every player in that season.\nNow load that data.\nTo cluster this data properly, we have some work to do.\nFirst, it won’t do to have players who haven’t played, so we can use filter to find anyone with greater than 0 minutes played. Next, Jalen Smith is a forward, so let’s just look at forwards. Third, we want to limit the data to things that make sense to look at for Smith – things like shooting, rebounds, blocks, turnovers and points.\nNow, k-means clustering doesn’t work as well with data that can be on different scales. So comparing a percentage to a count metric – shooting percentage to points – would create chaos because shooting percentages are a fraction of 1 and points, depending on when they are in the season, could be quite large. So we have to scale each metric – put them on a similar basis using the distance from the max value as our guide. Also, k-means clustering won’t work with text data, so we need to create a dataframe that’s just the numbers, but scaled. We can do that with another select, and using mutate_all with the scale function. The na.omit() means get rid of any blanks, because they too will cause errors.\nWith k-means clustering, we decide how many clusters we want. Most often, researchers will try a handful of different cluster numbers and see what works. But there are methods for finding the optimal number. One method is called the Elbow method. One implementation of this, borrowed from the University of Cincinnati’s Business Analytics program, does this quite nicely with a graph that will help you decide for yourself.\nAll you need to do in this code is change out the data frame – playersscaled in this case – and run it.\nThe Elbow method – so named because you’re looking for the “elbow” where the line flattens out. In this case, it looks like a K of 8 is ideal. So let’s try that. We’re going to use the kmeans function, saving it to an object called k5. We just need to tell it our dataframe name, how many centers (k) we want, and we’ll use a sensible default for how many different configurations to try.\nLet’s look at what we get.\nInterpreting this output, the very first thing you need to know is that the cluster numbers are meaningless. They aren’t ranks. They aren’t anything. After you have taken that on board, look at the cluster sizes at the top. Clusters 3 and 4 are pretty large compared to others. That’s notable. Then we can look at the cluster means. For reference, 0 is going to be average. So group 1 is below average on minutes played. Groups 8 is slightly above, group 5 is well above.\nSo which group is Jalen Smith in? Well, first we have to put our data back together again. In K8, there is a list of cluster assignments in the same order we put them in, but recall we have no names. So we need to re-combine them with our original data. We can do that with the following:\nNow we have a dataframe called playercluster that has our player names and what cluster they are in. The fastest way to find Jalen Smith is to double click on the playercluster table in the environment and use the search in the top right of the table. Because this is based on some random selections of points to start the groupings, these may change from person to person, but Smith is in Group 2 in my data.\nWe now have a dataset and can plot it like anything else. Let’s get Cam Mack and then plot him against the rest of college basketball on rebounds versus minutes played.\nSo Jalen’s in cluster 2, which if you look at our clusters, puts him in the cluster with all above average metrics. What does that look like? We know Jalen was a rebounding machine, so where do group 2 people grade out on rebounds?\nNot bad, not bad. But who are Jalen Smith’s peers? If we look at the numbers in Group 2, there’s 495 of them. So let’s limit them to just Big Ten guards. Unfortunately, my scraper didn’t quite work and in the place of Conference is the coach’s name. So I’m going to have to do this the hard way and make a list of Big Ten teams and filter on that. Then I’ll sort by minutes played.\nSo there are the 4 forwards most like Jalen Smith in the Big Ten. Are they the best forwards in the conference?"

A few weeks into the next season, he was 7 for 39 – a paltry .179.\nIs something wrong or is this just bad luck?\nLuck is something that comes up a lot in sports. Is a team unlucky? Or a player? One way we can get to this, we can get to that is by simulating things based on their typical percentages. Simulations work by choosing random values within a range based on a distribution. The most common distribution is the normal or binomial distribution. The normal distribution is where the most cases appear around the mean, 66 percent of cases are within one standard deviation from the mean, and the further away from the mean you get, the more rare things become.\nLet’s simulate 39 three point attempts 1000 times with his season long shooting percentage and see if this could just be random chance or something else.\nWe do this using a base R function called rbinom or binomial distribution. So what that means is there’s a normally distributed chance that James Palmer Jr. is going to shoot above and below his career three point shooting percentage. If we randomly assign values in that distribution 1000 times, how many times will it come up 7, like this example?\nHow do we read this? The first row and the second row form a pair. The top row is the number of shots made. The number immediately under it is the number of simulations where that occurred.\nSo what we see is given his season long shooting percentage, it’s not out of the realm of randomness that with just 39 attempts for Palmer, he’s only hit only 7. In 1000 simulations, it comes up 35 times. Is he below where he should be? Yes. Will he likely improve and soon? Unless something is very wrong, yes. And indeed, by the end of the season, he finished with a .313 shooting percentage from 3 point range. So we can say he was just unlucky."

This workflow will represent a clear picture of what your work in this class will be like for much of the rest of the semester. One way to think of this workflow is that your R Notebook is now your digital sketchbook, where you will try different types of visualizations to find ones that work. Then, you will either write the code that adds necessary and required parts to finish it, or you’ll export your work into a program like Illustrator to finish the work.\nTo begin, we’ll use data we’ve seen before: college football attendance.\nNow load the tidyverse.\nAnd the data.\nFirst, let’s get a top 10 list by announced attendance in the most recent season we have data. We’ll use the same tricks we used in the filtering assignment.\nThat looks good, so let’s save it to a new data frame and use that data frame instead going forward."

    "section": "15.1 The bar chart",
    "text": "15.1 The bar chart\nThe easiest thing we can do is create a simple bar chart of our data. Bar charts show magnitude. They invite you to compare how much more or less one thing is compared to others.\nWe could, for instance, create a bar chart of the total attendance. To do that, we simply tell ggplot2 what our dataset is, what element of the data we want to make the bar chart out of (which is the aesthetic), and the geometry type (which is the geom). It looks like this:\nggplot() + geom_bar(data=top10, aes(x=Institution))\nNote: top10 is our data, aes means aesthetics, x=Institution explicitly tells ggplot2 that our x value – our horizontal value – is the Institution field from the data, and then we add on the geom_bar() as the geometry. And what do we get when we run that?\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=top10, \n    aes(x=Institution)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nWe get … weirdness. We expected to see bars of different sizes, but we get all with a count of 1. What gives? Well, this is the default behavior. What we have here is something called a histogram, where ggplot2 helpfully counted up the number of times the Institution appears and counted them up. Since we only have one record per Institution, the count is always 1. How do we fix this? By adding weight to our aesthetic.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=top10, \n    aes(x=Institution, weight=`2019`)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCloser. But … what order is that in? And what happened to our count numbers on the left? Why are they in scientific notation?\nLet’s deal with the ordering first. ggplot2’s default behavior is to sort the data by the x axis variable. So it’s in alphabetical order. To change that, we have to reorder it. With reorder, we first have to tell ggplot what we are reordering, and then we have to tell it HOW we are reordering it. So it’s reorder(FIELD, SORTFIELD).\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=top10, \n    aes(\n      x=reorder(Institution, `2019`), \n      weight=`2019`\n      )\n    )\n\n\n\n\nBetter. We can argue about if the right order is smallest to largest or largest to smallest. But this gets us close. By the way, to sort it largest to smallest, put a negative sign in front of the sort field.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=top10, \n    aes(\n      x=reorder(Institution, -`2019`), \n      weight=`2019`\n      )\n    )"

More often that not, that means doing something like putting it on a logarithmic scale or some other kind of transformation. In this case, we’re just changing how it’s represented. The default in ggplot2 for large values is to express them as scientific notation. Rarely ever is that useful in our line of work. So we have to transform them into human readable numbers.\nThe easiest way to do this is to use a library called scales and it’s already installed.\n\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'scales'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    discard\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:readr':\n\n    col_factor\n\n\nTo alter the scale, we add a piece to our plot with + and we tell it which scale is getting altered and what kind of data it is. In our case, our Y axis is what is needing to be altered, and it’s continuous data (meaning it can be any number between x and y, vs discrete data which are categorical). So we need to add scale_y_continuous and the information we want to pass it is to alter the labels with a function called comma.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=top10, \n    aes(\n      x=reorder(Institution, -`2019`), \n      weight=`2019`\n      )\n    ) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma)\n\n\n\n\nBetter."

This is what ggplot needs. Save it to a new dataframe.\n\nyards %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"Season\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Yards\") -> yardswide\n\nBuilding on what we learned in the last chapter, we know we can turn this into a bar chart with an x value, a weight and a geom_bar. What we are going to add is a fill. The fill will stack bars on each other based on which element it is. In this case, we can fill the bar by Type, which means it will stack the number of rushing yards on top of passing yards and we can see how they compare.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=yardswide, aes(x=Team, weight=Yards, fill=Type)) + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the problem with this chart?\nThere’s a couple of things, one of which we’ll deal with now: The ordering is alphabetical (from the bottom up). So let’s reorder the teams by Yards.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=yardswide, aes(x=reorder(Team, Yards), weight=Yards, fill=Type)) + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\nAnd just like that … Ohio State comes out on top, and Maryland third. Not exactly a “three yards and a cloud of dust” conference."

Let’s start simple: Wins.\nWe can group by date and conference and sum up the wins. How many wins by day does each conference get?\n\ndates <- logs %>% group_by(date, conference) %>% summarise(wins = sum(win))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'date'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nEarlier, we did stacked bar charts. We have what we need to do that now.\n\nggplot() + geom_bar(data=dates, aes(x=date, weight=wins, fill=conference)) + theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nEeek. This is already looking not great. But to make it a circular bar chart, we add coord_polar() to our chart.\n\nggplot() + geom_bar(data=dates, aes(x=date, weight=wins, fill=conference)) + theme_minimal() + coord_polar()\n\n\n\n\nBased on that, the day is probably too thin a slice, and there’s way too many conferences in college basketball. Let’s group this by months and filter out all but the power five conferences.\n\np5 <- c(\"SEC\", \"Big Ten\", \"Pac-12\", \"Big 12\", \"ACC\")\n\nTo get months, we’re going to use a function in the library lubridate called floor_date, which combine with mutate will give us a field of just months.\n\nwins <- logs %>% mutate(month = floor_date(date, unit=\"months\")) %>% group_by(month, conference) %>% summarise(wins=sum(win)) %>% filter(conference %in% p5) \n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'month'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nNow we can use wins to make our circular bar chart of wins by month in the Power Five.\n\nggplot() + geom_bar(data=wins, aes(x=month, weight=wins, fill=conference)) + theme_minimal() + coord_polar()\n\n\n\n\nYikes. That looks a lot like a broken pie chart. So months are too thick of a slice. Let’s use weeks in our floor date to see what that gives us.\n\nwins <- logs %>% mutate(week = floor_date(date, unit=\"weeks\")) %>% group_by(week, conference) %>% summarise(wins=sum(win)) %>% filter(conference %in% p5) \n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\nggplot() + geom_bar(data=wins, aes(x=week, weight=wins, fill=conference)) + theme_minimal() + coord_polar()\n\n\n\n\nThat looks better. But what does it say? Does November basketball matter? What this is saying is … yeah, it kinda does. The reason? Lots of wins get piled up in November and December, during non-conference play. So if you are a team with NCAA tournament dreams, you need to win games in November to make sure your tournament resume is where it needs to be come March. Does an individual win or loss matter? Probably not. But your record in November does."

    "text": "17.2 Does it show you where you are?\nSo here is the problem we have:\n\nWe have data for every game. In the past, we were able to calculate the team wins and losses because the way the data records them is team is the main team, and they win or lose. The opponent is recorded, but not in its own column of that name. In addition, the opponent has the mirror image of this game as well, where they are team. So essentially every game is in here twice – one for each team that plays in the game.\nWe need to attach the opponent’s winning percentage to each game so we can decide if it’s a quality win for team.\n\nFirst we need to populate opponent based on the whatever is not the team. Then what we have to do is invert the process that we’ve done before. We need to group by the opponent and we need to invert the wins and losses. A win in the win column is a win for the team. That means each loss in the win column is a WIN for the opponent.\nOnce we invert, the data looks very similar to what we’ve done before. One other thing: I noticed there’s some tournament games in here, so the filter at the end strips them out.\n\nlogs <- logs %>% mutate(opponent = case_when(\n  team == home_team_name ~ away_team_name,\n  team == away_team_name ~ home_team_name\n))\n\noppwinlosslogs <- logs %>% mutate(winloss = case_when(\n  grepl(\"W\", win) ~ 0, \n  grepl(\"L\", win) ~ 1)\n) %>% filter(date < \"2022-03-14\")\n\nSo now we have a dataframe called oppwinlosslogs that has an inverted winloss column. So now we can group by the Opponent and sum the wins and it will tell us how many games the Opponent won. We can also count the wins and get a winning percentage.\n\noppwinlosslogs %>% group_by(opponent) %>% summarise(games=n(), wins=sum(win)) %>% mutate(winpct = wins/games) -> opprecord\n\nNow we have a dataframe of 1,316 opponent winning records. Wait, what? There’s like ~350 teams in major college basketball, so why 1,316? If you look through it, there’s a bunch of teams playing lower level teams. Given that they are lower level, they’re likely cannon fodder and will lose the game, and we’re going to filter them out in a minute.\nNow we can join the opponent winning percentage to our winlosslogs data so we can answer our question about quality wins.\n\nwinlosslogs <- logs %>% mutate(winloss = case_when(\n  grepl(\"W\", win) ~ 1, \n  grepl(\"L\", win) ~ 0)\n) %>% filter(date < \"2022-03-13\")\n\n\nwinlosslogs %>% left_join(opprecord, by=(\"opponent\")) -> winswithopppct\n\nNow that we have a table called winswithopppct, we can filter out non-power 5 teams and teams that won less than 60 percent of their games and run the same calculations in the book.\n\np5 <- c(\"SEC\", \"Big Ten\", \"Pac-12\", \"Big 12\", \"ACC\")\n\n\nwinswithopppct %>% filter(winpct > .6) %>% mutate(week = floor_date(date, unit=\"weeks\")) %>% group_by(week, conference) %>% summarise(wins=sum(win)) %>% filter(conference %in% p5) -> qualitywins\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'week'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nNow with our dataframe called qualitywins, we can chart it again.\n\nggplot() + geom_bar(data=qualitywins, aes(x=week, weight=wins, fill=conference)) + theme_minimal() + coord_polar()\n\n\n\n\nLook at this chart and compare it to the first one."

    "text": "18.1 Making waffles with vectors\nLet’s look at Maryland’s football bowl game win over Virginia Tech last year. Here’s the box score, which we’ll use for this part of the walkthrough.\nMaybe the easiest way to do waffle charts, at least at first, is to make vectors of your data and plug them in. To make a vector, we use the c or concatenate function.\nSo let’s look at offense. Rushing vs passing.\n\nmd <- c(\"Rushing\"=206, \"Passing\"=275)\nvt <- c(\"Rushing\"=122, \"Passing\"=137)\n\nSo what does the breakdown of the night look like?\nThe waffle library can break this down in a way that’s easier on the eyes than a pie chart. We call the library, add the data, specify the number of rows, give it a title and an x value label, and to clean up a quirk of the library, we’ve got to specify colors.\n\nwaffle(\n        md, \n        rows = 10, \n        title=\"Maryland's offense\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 yard\", \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\")\n)\n\n\n\n\nOr, we could make this two teams in the same chart.\n\npassing <- c(\"Maryland\"=275, \"Virginia Tech\"=137)\n\n\nwaffle(\n        passing, \n        rows = 10, \n        title=\"Maryland vs Virginia Tech: passing\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 yard\", \n        colors = c(\"red\", \"black\")\n)\n\n\n\n\nSo what does it look like if we compare the two teams using the two vectors in the same chart? To do that – and I am not making this up – you have to create a waffle iron. Get it? Waffle charts? Iron?\n\niron(\n waffle(md, \n        rows = 10, \n        title=\"Maryland's offense\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 yard\", \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\")\n        ),\n waffle(vt, \n        rows = 10, \n        title=\"Virginia Tech's offense\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 yard\", \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\")\n        )\n)\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you notice about this chart? Notice how the squares aren’t the same size? Well, Maryland out-gained Virginia Tech by a long way. So the squares aren’t the same size because the numbers aren’t the same. We can fix that by adding an unnamed padding number so the number of yards add up to the same thing. Let’s make the total for everyone be 481, Maryland’s total yards of offense. So to do that, we need to add a padding of 222 to Virginia Tech. REMEMBER: Don’t name it or it’ll show up in the legend.\n\nmd <- c(\"Rushing\"=206, \"Passing\"=275)\nvt <- c(\"Rushing\"=122, \"Passing\"=137, 222)\n\nNow, in our waffle iron, if we don’t give that padding a color, we’ll get an error. So we need to make it white. Which, given our white background, means it will disappear.\n\niron(\n waffle(md, \n        rows = 10, \n        title=\"Maryland's offense\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 yard\", \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\")\n        ),\n waffle(vt, \n        rows = 10, \n        title=\"Virginia Tech's offense\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 yard\",\n        colors = c(\"orange\", \"brown\", \"white\")\n        )\n)\n\n\n\n\nOne last thing we can do is change the 1 square = 1 yard bit – which makes the squares really small in this case – by dividing our vector. Look, it’s math on vectors!\n\niron(\n waffle(md/2, \n        rows = 10, \n        title=\"Maryland's offense\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 yard\", \n        colors = c(\"black\", \"red\")\n        ),\n waffle(vt/2, \n        rows = 10, \n        title=\"Virginia Tech's offense\", \n        xlab=\"1 square = 1 yard\",\n        colors = c(\"orange\", \"brown\", \"white\")\n        )\n)\n\n\n\n\nNews flash: Virginia Tech is changing its fight song to “Everybody Hurts” by REM."

Another is John Burn-Murdoch’s work at the Financial Times (which is paywalled) about soccer stars. Here’s an example of his work outside the paywall.\nTo replicate this, we need cumulative data – data that is the running total of data at a given point. So think of it this way – Maryland scores 50 points in a basketball game and then 50 more the next, their cumulative total at two games is 100 points.\nStep charts can be used for all kinds of things – showing how a player’s career has evolved over time, how a team fares over a season, or franchise history. Let’s walk through an example.\nLet’s look at Fred Hoiberg’s team last season.\nFor this walkthrough:\n   Download csv file\n\nWe’ll need the tidyverse.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nAnd we need to load our logs data we just downloaded.\n\nlogs <- read_csv(\"data/logs21.csv\")\n\nRows: 8229 Columns: 48\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (8): Season, TeamFull, Opponent, HomeAway, W_L, URL, Conference, Team\ndbl  (39): Game, TeamScore, OpponentScore, TeamFG, TeamFGA, TeamFGPCT, Team3...\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nHere we’re going to look at the scoring differential of teams. If you score more than your opponent, you win. So it stands to reason that if you score a lot more than your opponent over the course of a season, you should be very good, right? Let’s see.\nThe first thing we’re going to do is calculate that differential. Then, we’ll group it by the team. After that, we’re going to summarize using a new function called cumsum or cumulative sum – the sum for each game as we go forward. So game 1’s cumsum is the differential of that game. Game 2’s cumsum is Game 1 + Game 2. Game 3 is Game 1 + 2 + 3 and so on.\n\ndifflogs <- logs %>% \n  mutate(Differential = TeamScore - OpponentScore) %>% \n  group_by(Team) %>% \n  mutate(CumDiff = cumsum(Differential))\n\nNow that we have the cumulative sum for each, let’s filter it down to just Big Ten teams.\n\nbigdiff <- difflogs %>% filter(Conference == \"Big Ten\")\n\nThe step chart is it’s own geom, so we can employ it just like we have the others. It works almost exactly the same as a line chart, but it uses the cumulative sum instead of a regular value and, as the name implies, creates a step like shape to the line instead of a curve.\n\nggplot() + geom_step(data=bigdiff, aes(x=Date, y=CumDiff, group=Team))\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try a different element of the aesthetic: color, but this time inside the aesthetic. Last time, we did the color outside. When you put it inside, you pass it a column name and ggplot will color each line based on what thing that is, and it will create a legend that labels each line that thing.\n\nggplot() + geom_step(data=bigdiff, aes(x=Date, y=CumDiff, group=Team, color=Team))\n\n\n\n\nFrom this, we can see a handful of teams in the Big Ten had negative point differentials last season. But which is which? And which one is Maryland? Too many colors and it’s too hard to tell. How to sort that out? Let’s add some helpers beyond layering.\nLet’s look at the top team plus Maryland.\n\numd <- bigdiff %>% filter(Team == \"Maryland\")\nil <- bigdiff %>% filter(Team == \"Illinois\")\n\nLet’s introduce a couple of new things here. First, note when I take the color OUT of the aesthetic, the legend disappears.\nThe second thing I’m going to add is the annotation layer. In this case, I am adding a text annotation layer, and I can specify where by adding in a x and a y value where I want to put it. This takes some finesse. After that, I’m going to add labels and a theme.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=bigdiff, aes(x=Date, y=CumDiff, group=Team), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_step(data=umd, aes(x=Date, y=CumDiff, group=Team), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_step(data=il, aes(x=Date, y=CumDiff, group=Team), color=\"orange\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=(as.Date(\"2021-02-10\")), y=-70, label=\"Maryland\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=(as.Date(\"2021-03-01\")), y=330, label=\"Illinois\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Date\", \n    y=\"Cumulative Point Differential\", \n    title=\"Maryland's late charge\", \n    subtitle=\"The Terps started solidly but didn't gain much until late in the season.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Derek Willis\") +\n  theme_minimal()"

To fix this, we’ll add colors.\nSo our choice of colors here is important. We want giveaways to be seen as bad and takeaways to be seen as good. So lets try red for giveaways and green for takeaways. To make this work, we’ll need to do three things: first, use the English spelling of color, so colour. The, uh, colour is the bar between the dots, the x_colour is the color of the x value dot and the xend_colour is the color of the xend dot. So in our setup, takeaways are x, they’re good, so they’re green.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(y=Team, x=Takeaways, xend=Giveaways),\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\nBetter. Let’s make two more tweaks. First, let’s make the whole thing bigger with a size element. And let’s add theme_minimal to clean out some cruft.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(y=Team, x=Takeaways, xend=Giveaways),\n    size = 1,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we have a chart that tells a story – got green on the right? That’s good. A long distance between green and red? Better. But what if we sort it by good turnovers?\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(y=reorder(Team, Takeaways), x=Takeaways, xend=Giveaways),\n    size = 1,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nBelieve it or not, Iowa had the most takeaways in the Big Ten this season."

    "text": "On the Monday, Sept. 21, 2020 edition of the Pick Six Podcast, Omaha World Herald reporter Sam McKewon talked a little about the Nebraska mens basketball team. Specifically the conversation was about a new roster release, and how the second year of Fred Hoiberg ball was going to look very different, starting with the heights of the players. After a near complete roster turnover, the players on the team now were nearly all taller than 6’4”, and one of the shorter ones is penciled in as the starting point guard.\nWhy is that important? One reason, McKewon posited, is that teams made a lot of three point shots on Nebraska. In fact, Nebraska finished dead last in the conference in three points shots made against them. McKewon chalked this up to bad perimeter defense, and that Nebraska needed to improve it. Being taller – or more specifically having the longer arms that go with being taller – will help with that, McKewon said.\nBetter perimeter defense, better team.\nWell, we know how the season went: 7 wins, same as the previous year.\nBut the question before you is this: is what McKewon said true? Does keeping a lid on your opponent’s ability to score three pointers mean more wins?\nThis is what we’re going to start to answer today. And we’ll do it with scatterplots and regressions. Scatterplots are very good at showing relationships between two numbers.\nFirst, we need libraries and every college basketball game from the 2019-2020 season. Why that season? Because I did this with the COVID season and everything was wonky and made no sense. To make it make sense, you had to do a ton of twisting and turning and that was pointless. What we’re interested in is less about a specific team and more about a general point: Are these numbers related and by how much? What can they tell you about your team in general?\nLoad the tidyverse.\nAnd the data.\nTo do this, we need all teams and their season stats. How much, team to team, does a thing matter? That’s the question you’re going to answer.\nIn our case, we want to know how much do three point shots made influence wins? How much difference can we explain in wins by knowing how many threes the other team made against you? We’re going to total up the number of threes each team allowed and their season wins in one swoop.\nTo do this, we need to use conditional logic – case_when in this case – to determine if the team won or lost the game. In this case, we’ll create a new column called winloss. Case when statements can be read like this: When This is True, Do This. This bit of code – which you can use in a lot of contexts in this class – uses the grepl function to look for the letter W in the W_L column and, if it finds it, makes winloss 1. If it finds an L, it makes it 0. Sum your winloss column and you have your season win total. The reason we have to use grepl to find W or L is because Sports Reference will record overtime wins differently than regular wins. Same with losses.\nNow we can get a dataframe together that gives us the total wins for each team, and the total three point shots made. We’ll call that new dataframe threedef.\nNow let’s look at the scatterplot. With a scatterplot, we put what predicts the thing on the X axis, and the thing being predicted on the Y axis. In this case, X is our three pointers given up, y is our wins.\nLet’s talk about this. This seems kind of random, but clustered around the middle. There’s not really a clear pattern here. But can we get a better sense of this? Yes, by adding another geom – geom_smooth. It’s identical to our geom_point, but we add a method to the end, which in this case we’re using the linear method or lm.\nA straight line across is bad. It means there’s no pattern here. The numbers don’t suggest anything. The dots are very spread out. Which is a clue that you should be asking a question here: how strong of a relationship is this? How much can threes given up explain wins? Can we put some numbers to this?\nOf course we can. We can apply a linear model to this – remember Chapter 9? We’re going to create an object called fit, and then we’re going to put into that object a linear model – lm – and the way to read this is “wins are predicted by opponent threes”. Then we just want the summary of that model.\nRemember from Chapter 9: There’s just a few things you really need.\nThe first thing: R-squared. In this case, the Adjusted R-squared value is -0.0004098, which we can interpret as the number of threes the opponent makes predicts about a teeny tiny percent of the variance in wins. Which sounds not great.\nSecond: The P-value. We want anything less than .05. If it’s above .05, the difference between them is not statistically significant – it’s probably explained by random chance. In our case, we have 0.7106. Is that more than .05? Yes. Yes it is. So this is random. There’s no relationship between the number of threes the opponent makes and the number of wins a team has.\nNormally, we’d stop here, but let’s look at the third element: The coefficient. In this case, the coefficient for TeamOpp3P is -0.001400. What this model predicts, given that and the intercept of 17.199150, is this: Every team starts with about 17 wins. For every 100 three pointers the other team makes, you lose .14 games off that total. So if you give up 100 threes in a season, you’ll be a 17 win team. Give up 200, you’re closer to a 16 win team, and so on. How am I doing that? Remember your algebra and y = mx + b. In this case, y is the wins, m is the coefficient, x is the number of threes given up and b is the intercept.\nLet’s use Maryland as an example. They had 227 threes scored on them in the 2019-2020 season.\ny = -0.001400 * 227 + 17.199150 or 16.8 wins.\nHow many wins did Maryland have? 24.\nWhat does that mean? It means that Maryland OVERPERFORMED according to this model. But our R-squared is so small that even if this weren’t random, it would be largely pointless. Put another way: more than 99 percent of the difference in wins between teams is predicted by something else.\nWhere is Maryland on the plot? We know we can use layering for that."

    "text": "21.1 Let’s see it work\nOne thing we do know is related is shooting percentage. Shoot better, win games. Simple. But how well does that work?\nWe could just average together each team’s shooting night, but this isn’t the same thing as the season shooting average. It’s the average of shooting percentages. To get the season average, we have to sum attempts and makes and do the math ourselves. Averaging the percentages will get us close, but be careful when you do things like this that you’re describing your number correctly.\nLet’s do this the hard – read: correct – way.\n\nshooting <- winlosslogs %>% \n  group_by(Team, season) %>% \n  summarise(\n    Wins = sum(winloss), \n    Shots = sum(TeamFGA),\n    Makes = sum(TeamFG)\n    ) %>% \n  mutate(AvgShootingPct = Makes/Shots) %>% \n  na.omit()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Team'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nNow we can chart it and see what our relationship looks like.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=shooting, aes(x=AvgShootingPct, y=Wins)) +\n  geom_smooth(data=shooting, aes(x=AvgShootingPct, y=Wins), method=\"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what a positive relationship looks like – sloping up and to the right. The better you shoot, the more you win. If it were reversed – the better you shot, the fewer wins you got, the line would start at the top left and go down to the right. The direction of the line indicates the relationship between the numbers.\nLet’s get our linear regression stats.\n\nshootfit <- lm(Wins ~ AvgShootingPct, data = shooting)\nsummary(shootfit)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Wins ~ AvgShootingPct, data = shooting)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-14.6777  -3.3738  -0.0529   3.0892  17.2843 \n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    \n(Intercept)     -50.733      1.862  -27.24   <2e-16 ***\nAvgShootingPct  153.367      4.218   36.36   <2e-16 ***\n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 4.91 on 2106 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.3857,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.3854 \nF-statistic:  1322 on 1 and 2106 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16\n\n\nThe p-value isn’t random. The adjusted R-squared is pushing 40 percent. We’ve got something here. Let’s use our coefficients to look at Maryland’s 2019-2020 season (not the COVID season, because all the numbers are super weird in that season).\n\n(153.942 * .419) + -50.733 \n\n[1] 13.7687\n\n\nSo this model says that based only on Maryland’s shooting percentage, they should have won 13 or 14 games. They won 24. So per our model, Maryland overperformed. Obviously there’s room for improvement in the model here, but you can see the power in scatterplots + regression."

    "text": "If you want to see it work spectacularly well, watch a semi-famous Ted Talk by Hans Rosling from 2006 where bubble charts were the centerpiece. It’s worth watching. It’ll change your perspective on the world. No seriously. It will.\nAnd since then, people have wanted bubble charts. And we’re back to the original problem: They’re hard. There’s a finite set of circumstances where they work.\nFirst, I’m going to show you an example of them not working to illustrate the point.\nI’m going to load up my libraries.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nSo for this example, I want to look at where Big Ten teams compare to the rest of college football last season. Is the Big Ten’s reputation for tough games and defenses earned? Can we see patterns in good team vs bad teams?\nI’m going to create a scatterplot with offensive yards per play on the X axis and defensive yards per play on the y axis. We can then divide the grid into four quadrants. Teams with high yards per offensive play and low defensive yards per play are teams with good offenses and good defenses. The opposite means bad defense, bad offense. Then, to drive the point home, I’m going to make the dot the size of the total wins on the season – the bubble in my bubble charts.\nWe’ll use last season’s college football games.\nFor this walkthrough:\n   Download csv file\n\nAnd load it.\n\nlogs <- read_csv(\"data/footballlogs21.csv\")\n\nRows: 1655 Columns: 54\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (8): HomeAway, Opponent, Result, TeamFull, TeamURL, Outcome, Team, Con...\ndbl  (45): Game, PassingCmp, PassingAtt, PassingPct, PassingYds, PassingTD, ...\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nTo do this, I’ve got some work to do. First, I need to mutate the outcomes of the games into 1s and 0s so I can add up the wins. We’ve done this before, so this won’t be new to you, just adjusted slightly from basketball data.\n\nwinlosslogs <- logs %>% \n  mutate(\n    wins = case_when(\n      grepl(\"W\", Outcome) ~ 1, \n      grepl(\"L\", Outcome) ~ 0)\n)\n\nNow I have some more work to do. My football logs data has the yards per play of each game, and I could average those together and get something very close to what I’m going to do, but averaging each games yards per play is not the same thing as calculating it, so we’re going to calculate it.\n\nwinlosslogs %>% \n  group_by(Team, Conference) %>% \n  summarise(\n    TotalPlays = sum(OffensivePlays), \n    TotalYards = sum(OffensiveYards), \n    DefensivePlays = sum(DefPlays), \n    DefensiveYards = sum(DefYards), \n    TotalWins = sum(wins)) %>% \n  mutate(\n    OffensiveYPP = TotalYards/TotalPlays, \n    DefensiveYPP = DefensiveYards/DefensivePlays) -> ypp\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Team'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nA bubble chart is just a scatterplot with one additional element in the aesthetic – a size. Here’s the scatterplot version.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP)\n    )\n\n\n\n\nLooks kind of random, eh? In this case, that’s not that bad because we’re not claiming a relationship. We’re saying the location on the chart has meaning. So, do teams on the bottom right – good offense, good defense – win more games?\nLet’s add the size element.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins)\n    )\n\n\n\n\nWhat does this chart tell you? We can see a general pattern that there are more big dots on the bottom right than the upper left. But we can make this more readable by adding an alpha element outside the aesthetic – alpha in this case is transparency – and we can manually change the size of the dots by adding scale_size and a range.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins),\n    alpha = .3) + \n  scale_size(range = c(3, 8), name=\"Wins\")\n\n\n\n\nAnd by now, you now know to add in the Big Ten as a layer, I would hope.\n\nbigten <- ypp %>% filter(Conference == \"Big Ten Conference\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=bigten, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\")\n\n\n\n\nLet’s add some things to this chart to help us out. First, let’s add lines that show us the average of all teams for those two metrics. So first, we need to calculate those. Because I have grouped data, it’s going to require me to ungroup it so I can get just the total average of those two numbers.\n\nypp %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  summarise(\n    offense = mean(OffensiveYPP), \n    defense = mean(DefensiveYPP)\n    )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  offense defense\n    <dbl>   <dbl>\n1    5.79    5.66\n\n\nNow we can use those averages to add two more geoms – geom_vline and geom_hline, for vertical lines and horizontal lines.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=bigten, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.863151) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.448228)\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s add another new geom for us, using a new library called ggrepel, which will help us label the dots without overwriting other labels. So we’ll have to install that in the console:\n`install.packages(“ggrepel”)\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nAnd with that, we can add labels to the dots. The geom_text_repel is pretty much the exact same thing as your Big Ten geom point, but instead of a size, you include a label.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=bigten, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.863151) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.448228) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=bigten, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label=Team)\n  )\n\n\n\n\nWell, what do you know about that? Maryland was … really a mixed bag this season.\nAll that’s left is some labels and some finishing touches.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=ypp, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=bigten, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, size=TotalWins), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.863151) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5.448228) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=bigten, \n    aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label=Team)\n  ) +\n  labs(title=\"Is Maryland moving up to the Big Ten's best?\", subtitle=\"The Terps offense and defense puts it among ranked teams in the conference.\", caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Derek Willis\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )"

    "text": "A beeswarm plot is sometimes called a column scatterplot. It’s an effective way to show how individual things – teams, players, etc. – are distributed along a numberline. The column is a grouping – say positions in basketball – and the dots are players, and the dots cluster where the numbers are more common. So think of it like a histogram mixed with a scatterplot crossed with a bar chart.\nAn example will help.\nFirst things first: Install ggbeeswarm with install.packages(\"ggbeeswarm\")\nLike ggalt and ggrepel, ggbeeswarm adds a couple new geoms to ggplot. We’ll need to load it, the tidyverse and, for later, ggrepel.\nAnother bit of setup: we need to set the seed for the random number generator. The library “jitters” the dots in the beeswarm randomly. If we don’t set the seed, we’ll get different results each time. Setting the seed means we get the same look.\nSo let’s look at last year’s women’s basketball team as a group of shooters. The team didn’t have the kind of success that was envisioned – we know that – but what kind of a problem is it going to be that we’re returning one regular starter (Diamond Miller) from it?\nFirst we’ll load our player data.\nWe know this data has a lot of players who didn’t play, so let’s get rid of them.\nNow let’s ask what makes a good shooter? The best measure, in my book, is True Shooting Percentage. It’s a combination of weighted field goal shooting – to account for three pointers – and free throws. Let’s calculate that and add it to our data.\nIf we include all players, we’ll have too many dots. So let’s narrow it down. A decent tool for cutoffs? Field goal attempts. Let’s get a quick look at them.\nThe median number of shots is 99, but we only really care about good ones. So let’s use 197 attempts – the third quartile – as our cutoff.\nNow we’ve got enough for a beeswarm plot. It works very much like you would expect – the group value is the x, the number is the y. We’re going to beeswarm by position, and the dots will be true shooting percentage.\nYou can see that there’s a lot fewer centers who have attempted more than 152 shots than guards, but then there’s a lot more guards in college basketball than anything else. In the guards column, note that fat width of the swarm is between .5 and .6. So that means most guards who shoot more than 197 shots end up in that area. They’re the average shooter at that level. You can see, some are better, some are worse.\nSo where are the Maryland players in that mix?\nWe’ll filter players on Maryland who meet our criteria.\nSeven Cornhuskers took more than 197 shots. Number returning this season? Two.\nBut how good are they as true shooters?\nWhen you add another beeswarm, we need to pass another element in – we need to tell it if we’re grouping on the x value. Not sure why, but you’ll get a warning if you don’t.\nOne very good guard, and some good forwards. Who are they?\nThis is where we can use ggrepel. Let’s add a text layer and label the dots.\nSo Katie Benzan was our best shooter by true shooting percentage. Most of the rest were at or above average shooters for that volume of shooting, but Miller and Sellers are the returnees, and both were near average."

We’re going to use a neat filter trick for this that you learned earlier using %in%.\n\ntop10 <- rankings %>% filter(Week == 17 & Rank <= 10)\n\nnewrankings <- rankings %>% filter(Team %in% top10$Team)\n\nNow you have something called newrankings that shows how teams who finished in the top 10 at the end of the season ended up there. And every team who finished in the top 10 in week 17 had been in the rankings more than once in the 5 weeks before.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(\n    data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team))\n\n\n\n\nFirst things first: I’m immediately annoyed by the top teams being at the bottom. I learned a neat trick from ggbump that’s been in ggplot all along – scale_y_reverse()\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(\n    data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team)) + \n  scale_y_reverse()\n\n\n\n\nBetter. But, still not great. Let’s add a point at each week.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team)) + \n  geom_point(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team), size = 4) +\n  scale_y_reverse() \n\n\n\n\nAnother step. That makes it more subway-map like. But the colors are all wrong. To fix this, we’re going to use scale_color_manual and we’re going to Google the hex codes for each team. The legend will tell you what order your scale_color_manual needs to be.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team)) + \n  geom_point(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team), size = 4) + \n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#9E1B32\",\"#E00122\", \"#F56600\", \"#0021A5\", \"#BA0C2F\", \"#F1BE48\",\"#C99700\", \"#bb0000\", \"#841617\", \"#500000\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse() \n\n\n\n\nAnother step. But the legend is annoying. And trying to find which red is Alabama vs Ohio State is hard. So what if we labeled each dot at the beginning and end? We can do that with some clever usage of geom_text and a little dplyr filtering inside the data step. We filter out the first and last weeks, then use hjust – horizontal justification – to move them left or right.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team)) + \n  geom_point(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team), size = 4) +   \n  geom_text(data = newrankings %>% filter(Week == min(Week)), aes(x = Week - .2, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = newrankings %>% filter(Week == max(Week)), aes(x = Week + .2, y=Rank, label = Team), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#9E1B32\",\"#E00122\", \"#F56600\", \"#0021A5\", \"#BA0C2F\", \"#F1BE48\",\"#C99700\", \"#bb0000\", \"#841617\", \"#500000\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse() \n\n\n\n\nBetter, but the legend is still there. We can drop it in a theme directive by saying legend.position = \"none\". We’ll also throw a theme_minimal on there to drop the default grey, and we’ll add some better labeling.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team)) + \n  geom_point(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team), size = 4) +   \n  geom_text(data = newrankings %>% filter(Week == min(Week)), aes(x = Week - .2, y=Rank, label = ShortTeam), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = newrankings %>% filter(Week == max(Week)), aes(x = Week + .2, y=Rank, label = ShortTeam), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  labs(title=\"Was COVID college football boring?\", subtitle=\"There was no drama at the top. None. So, yes?\", y= \"Rank\", x = \"Week\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#9E1B32\",\"#E00122\", \"#F56600\", \"#0021A5\", \"#BA0C2F\", \"#F1BE48\",\"#C99700\", \"#bb0000\", \"#841617\", \"#500000\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse() \n\n\n\n\nNow let’s fix our text hierarchy.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team)) + \n  geom_point(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team), size = 4) +   \n  geom_text(data = newrankings %>% filter(Week == min(Week)), aes(x = Week - .2, y=Rank, label = ShortTeam), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = newrankings %>% filter(Week == max(Week)), aes(x = Week + .2, y=Rank, label = ShortTeam), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  labs(title=\"Was COVID college football boring?\", subtitle=\"There was no drama at the top. None. So, yes?\", y= \"Rank\", x = \"Week\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#9E1B32\",\"#E00122\", \"#F56600\", \"#0021A5\", \"#BA0C2F\", \"#F1BE48\",\"#C99700\", \"#bb0000\", \"#841617\", \"#500000\")) +\n  scale_y_reverse() \n\n\n\n\nAnd the last thing: anyone else annoyed at 7.5th place on the left? We can fix that too by specifying the breaks in scale_y_reverse. We can do that with the x axis as well, but since we haven’t reversed it, we do that in scale_x_continuous with the same breaks. Also: forgot my source and credit line.\nOne last thing: Let’s change the width of the chart to make the names fit. We can do that by adding fig.width=X in the {r} setup in your block. So something like this:\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bump(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team)) + \n  geom_point(data=newrankings, aes(x=Week, y=Rank, color=Team), size = 4) +   \n  geom_text(data = newrankings %>% filter(Week == min(Week)), aes(x = Week - .2, y=Rank, label = ShortTeam), size = 3, hjust = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = newrankings %>% filter(Week == max(Week)), aes(x = Week + .2, y=Rank, label = ShortTeam), size = 3, hjust = 0) +\n  labs(title=\"Was COVID college football boring?\", subtitle=\"There was no drama at the top.

    "text": "Sometimes, the best way to show your data is with a table – simple rows and columns. It allows a reader to compare whatever they want to compare a little easier than a graph where you’ve chosen what to highlight. The folks that made R Studio and the tidyverse have a neat package called gt.\nFor this assignment, we’ll need gt so go over to the console and run:\ninstall.packages(\"gt\")\nSo what does all of these libraries do? Let’s gather a few and use data of every men’s basketball game between 2015-2020.\nFor this walkthrough:\n   Download csv file\n\nLoad libraries.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\n\nAnd the data.\n\nlogs <- read_csv(\"data/logs1520.csv\")\n\nRows: 68617 Columns: 44\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (6): HomeAway, Opponent, W_L, Team, Conference, season\ndbl  (36): X1, Game, TeamScore, OpponentScore, TeamFG, TeamFGA, TeamFGPCT, T...\nlgl   (1): Blank\ndate  (1): Date\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nLet’s ask this question: which college basketball team saw the greatest increase in three point attempts last season as a percentage of shots? The simplest way to calculate that is by percent change.\nWe’ve got a little work to do, putting together ideas we’ve used before. What we need to end up with is some data that looks like this:\nTeam | 2018-2019 season threes | 2019-2020 season threes | pct change\nTo get that, we’ll need to do some filtering to get the right seasons, some grouping and summarizing to get the right number, some pivoting to get it organized correctly so we can mutate the percent change.\n\nthreechange <- logs %>%\n  filter(season == \"2018-2019\" | season == \"2019-2020\") %>%\n  group_by(Team, Conference, season) %>%\n  summarise(Total3PA = sum(Team3PA)) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from=season, values_from = Total3PA) %>%\n  mutate(PercentChange = (`2019-2020`-`2018-2019`)/`2018-2019`) %>%\n  arrange(desc(PercentChange)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  top_n(10) # just want a top 10 list\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Team', 'Conference'. You can override\nusing the `.groups` argument.\nSelecting by PercentChange\n\n\nWe’ve output tables to the screen a thousand times in this class with head, but gt makes them look decent with very little code.\n\nthreechange %>% gt()\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Team\n      Conference\n      2018-2019\n      2019-2020\n      PercentChange\n    \n  \n  \n    Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils\nSWAC\n554\n837\n0.5108303\n    Valparaiso Crusaders\nMVC\n585\n843\n0.4410256\n    Ball State Cardinals\nMAC\n621\n842\n0.3558776\n    San Jose State Spartans\nMWC\n641\n861\n0.3432137\n    Alabama Crimson Tide\nSEC\n718\n957\n0.3328691\n    Minnesota Golden Gophers\nBig Ten\n603\n762\n0.2636816\n    Georgia Southern Eagles\nSun Belt\n631\n792\n0.2551506\n    Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles\nOVC\n620\n776\n0.2516129\n    San Francisco Dons\nWCC\n728\n899\n0.2348901\n    McNeese State Cowboys\nSouthland\n547\n675\n0.2340037\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nSo there you have it. Mississippi Valley State changed their team so much they took 51 percent more threes in 2019-20 from the season before. Where did Maryland come out? We ranked 49th in college basketball in terms of change from the season before.\ngt has a mountain of customization options. The good news is that it works in a very familiar pattern. We’ll start with fixing headers. What we have isn’t bad, but PercentChange isn’t good either. Let’s fix that.\n\nthreechange %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  cols_label(\n    PercentChange = \"Percent Change\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n      Team\n      Conference\n      2018-2019\n      2019-2020\n      Percent Change\n    \n  \n  \n    Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils\nSWAC\n554\n837\n0.5108303\n    Valparaiso Crusaders\nMVC\n585\n843\n0.4410256\n    Ball State Cardinals\nMAC\n621\n842\n0.3558776\n    San Jose State Spartans\nMWC\n641\n861\n0.3432137\n    Alabama Crimson Tide\nSEC\n718\n957\n0.3328691\n    Minnesota Golden Gophers\nBig Ten\n603\n762\n0.2636816\n    Georgia Southern Eagles\nSun Belt\n631\n792\n0.2551506\n    Tennessee Tech Golden Eagles\nOVC\n620\n776\n0.2516129\n    San Francisco Dons\nWCC\n728\n899\n0.2348901\n    McNeese State Cowboys\nSouthland\n547\n675\n0.2340037\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nBetter. Note the pattern: Actual header name = “What we want to see”. So if we wanted to change Team to School, we’d do this: Team = \"School\" inside the cols_label bits.\nNow we can start working with styling. The truth is most of your code in tables is going to be dedicated to styling specific things. The first thing we need: A headline and some chatter. They’re required parts of a graphic, so they’re a good place to start. We do that with tab_header\n\nthreechange %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  cols_label(\n    PercentChange = \"Percent Change\"\n  ) %>%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Did Maryland Shoot More Threes in 2019-20?\",\n    subtitle = \"Yes, but it wasn't a big change.

Edward Tufte, one of the most well known data visualization thinkers on the planet, calls this “small multiples” where ggplot calls this a facet wrap or a facet grid, depending.\nOne thing we noticed earlier in the semester – it seems that a lot of teams shoot worse as the season goes on. Do they? We could answer this a number of ways, but the best way to show people would be visually. Let’s use Small Multiples.\nAs always, we start with libraries.\nWe’re going to use the logs of college basketball games last season.\nAnd load it.\nLet’s narrow our pile and look just at the Big Ten.\nThe first thing we can do is look at a line chart, like we have done in previous chapters.\nAnd, not surprisingly, we get a hairball. We could color certain lines, but that would limit us to focus on one team. What if we did all of them at once? We do that with a facet_wrap. The only thing we MUST pass into a facet_wrap is what thing we’re going to separate them out by. In this case, we precede that field with a tilde, so in our case we want the Team field. It looks like this:\nAnswer: Not immediately clear, but we can look at this and analyze it. We could add a piece of annotation to help us out.\nWhat do you see here? How do teams compare? How do they change over time? I’m not asking you these questions because they’re an assignment – I’m asking because that’s exactly what this chart helps answer. Your brain will immediately start making those connections."

For example – both charts don’t need x or y labels. If you don’t have a title and subtitle on both, the spacing is off, so you need to leave one blank or the other blank.

    "text": "One thing we’ve talked about all semester is drawing attention to the thing you want to draw attention to. We’ve used color and labels to do that so far. Let’s add another layer to it – a shape around the points you want to highlight.\nRemember: The point of all of this is to draw the eye to what you are trying to show your reader. You want people to see the story you are trying to tell.\nIt’s not hard to draw a shape in ggplot – it is a challenge to put it in the right place. But, there is a library to the rescue that makes this super easy – ggalt.\nInstall it in the console with install.packages(\"ggalt\")\nThere’s a bunch of things that ggalt does, but one of the most useful for us is the function encircle. Let’s dive in.\nLet’s say we want to highlight the top scorers in women’s college basketball. So let’s use our player data.\nAnd while we’re loading it, let’s filter out anyone who hasn’t played.\nWe’ve done this before, but let’s make a standard scatterplot of minutes and points.\nSo we can see right away that there are some dots at the very top that we’d want to highlight. Who are these scoring machines?\nLike we have done in the past, let’s make a dataframe of top scorers. We’ll set the cutoff at 700 points in a season.\nAnd like we’ve done in the past, we can add it to the chart with another geom_point. We’ll make all the players grey, we’ll make all the top scorers black.\nAnd like that, we’re on the path to something publishable. We’ll need to label those dots with ggrepel and we’ll need to drop the default grey and add some headlines and all that. And, for the most part, we’ve got a solid chart.\nBut what if we could really draw the eye to those players. Let’s draw a circle around them. In ggalt, there is a new geom called geom_encircle, which … does what you think it does. It encircles all the dots in a dataset.\nSo let’s add geom_encircle and we’ll just copy the data and the aes from our topscorers geom_point. Then, we need to give the encirclement a shape using s_shape – which is a number between 0 and 1 – and then how far away from the dots to draw the circle using expand, which is another number between 0 and 1.\nLet’s start with s_shape 1 and expand 1.\nWhoa. That’s … not good.\nLet’s go the opposite direction.\nBetter, but … the circle cuts through multiple dots.\nThis takes a little bit of finessing, but a shape of .5 means the line will have some bend to it – it’ll look more like someone circled it with a pen. Then, the expand is better if you use hundredths instead of tenths. So .01 instead of .1. Here’s mine after fiddling with it for a bit, and I’ll add in player names as a label.\nNow let’s clean this up and make it presentable. If you look at the top scorers, four were Wooden Award finalists. So here’s what a chart telling that story might look like."

As of now, only one will be coming back.\n\nmdtop <- players %>% filter(team == \"Maryland\") %>% top_n(3, fg3a)\n\nAnd just like above, we can plug in our players geom, our mdtop dataframe into another geom, then encircle that dataframe. Slap some headlines and annotations on it and here’s what we get:\n\nggplot() + geom_point(data=players, aes(x=mp, y=fg3a), color=\"grey\") + geom_point(data=mdtop, aes(x=mp, y=fg3a), color=\"red\") + geom_encircle(data=mdtop, aes(x=mp, y=fg3a), s_shape=.02, expand=.18, colour=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=400, y=100, label=\"Maryland's top three shooters\")) + \n  labs(title=\"The Big Three?\", subtitle=\"Maryland's top three point shooters not among the leaders in college basketball \", x=\"Minutes\", y=\"Three point attempts\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\nFrom the top, Maryland’s dots are Katie Benzan, Chloe Bibby and … Shyanne Sellers, the true freshman."

So we need to get rid of that.\nTo do this, we’re going to use a little regular expression magic. Regular expressions are a programmatic way to find any pattern in text. What we’re looking for is that \\\\ business. But, that presents a problem, because the \\ is a special character. It’s called an escape character. That escape character means what comes next is potentially special. For instance, if you see \\n, that’s a newline character. So normally, if you see that, it would add a return.\nSo for us to get rid of the \\ we’re going to have to escape the escape character with an escape character. And we have two of them. So we have to do it twice.\nYes. Really.\nSo if we wanted to find two backslashes, we need \\\\\\\\. Then, using regular expressions, we can say “and then everything else after this” with this: .*\nNo really. That’s it. So we’re looking for \\\\\\\\.*. That’ll find two backslashes and then everything after it. If you think this is hard … you’re right. Regular expressions are an entire month of a programming course by themselves. They are EXTREMELY powerful.\nTo find something in text, we’ll use a function called gsub. The pattern in gsub is pattern, what we want to replace it with, what column this can all be found in. So in our example, the pattern is \\\\\\\\.*, what we want to replace it with is … nothing, and this is all in the Player column. Here’s the code.\n\nnbaplayers %>% mutate(Player=gsub(\"\\\\\\\\.*\",\"\",Player)) %>% head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 29\n     Rk Player     Pos     Age Tm        G    MP   PER `TS%` `3PAr`   FTr `ORB%`\n  <dbl> <chr>      <chr> <dbl> <chr> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl>\n1     1 Steven Ad… C        26 OKC      58  1564  20.8 0.605  0.007 0.413   14.4\n2     2 Bam Adeba… PF       22 MIA      65  2235  20.6 0.606  0.018 0.476    8.7\n3     3 LaMarcus … C        34 SAS      53  1754  19.8 0.571  0.198 0.241    6.3\n4     4 Nickeil A… SG       21 NOP      41   501   7.6 0.441  0.515 0.123    1.7\n5     5 Grayson A… SG       24 MEM      30   498  11.4 0.577  0.517 0.199    1.1\n6     6 Jarrett A… C        21 BRK      64  1647  20.3 0.658  0.012 0.574   12.5\n# … with 17 more variables: `DRB%` <dbl>, `TRB%` <dbl>, `AST%` <dbl>,\n#   `STL%` <dbl>, `BLK%` <dbl>, `TOV%` <dbl>, `USG%` <dbl>, ...20 <lgl>,\n#   OWS <dbl>, DWS <dbl>, WS <dbl>, `WS/48` <dbl>, ...25 <lgl>, OBPM <dbl>,\n#   DBPM <dbl>, BPM <dbl>, VORP <dbl>\n\n\nJust like that, the trash is gone."

What story is the chart telling? What made it interesting to you? Don’t tell me what the stats are, tell me what it says.\nYour headline should be specific. Generic headlines are boring and ignored.\nYour headline should, most often, have a verb. It’s not a 100 percent requirement, but a headline without a verb means you’re trying to be cute and …\nYour headline shouldn’t be overly cute. Trying to get away with slang, a very Of The Moment cultural reference that will be forgotten soon, or some inside joke is asking for trouble.\nYour headline should provoke a reaction.\n\nGiven our graph, here’s a few that don’t work.\n\nggplot(offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`)) + \n  geom_point(color=\"grey\") + geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  labs(x=\"Total yards per game\", y=\"Points per game\", title=\"Maryland's offense\", subtitle=\"Maryland's 2018 offense is the red dot.\", caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Derek Willis\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`, label=\"Maryland 2018\"))\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nThe problems here:\n\nNo verb.\nGeneric, forgettable, doesn’t say anything.\nWhat is this chart about? What does it say? We have no idea from the headline and chatter.\nDon’t repeat words from the headline in the chatter. Nebraska Nebraska looks bad. Make one of the Huskers if you’re going to do this.\n\nAnother example:\n\nggplot(offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`)) + \n  geom_point(color=\"grey\") + geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  labs(x=\"Total yards per game\", y=\"Points per game\", title=\"Points per game vs total yards per game\", subtitle=\"Maryland's 2018 offense is above the blue line, which is good.\", caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Derek Willis\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`, label=\"Maryland 2018\"))\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s wrong here?\n\nThe headline is about the stats, not the story.\nThe headline lacks a verb.\nThe headline lacks any interest, really.\nThe headline at least moves in the direction of what this chart is about, but see the previous two.\nThe chatter adds more flavor to it, but what does “below the blue line” even mean? We’re leaving the reader with a lot of questions and no real answers. That;s bad.\n\nLet’s try to do this better.\n\nggplot(offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`)) + \n  geom_point(color=\"grey\") + geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  labs(x=\"Total yards per game\", y=\"Points per game\", title=\"Maryland's strength\", subtitle=\"The Terps' offense was supposed to power the team, and it did.\", caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Derek Willis\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`, label=\"Maryland 2018\"))\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat works here:\n\nProvokes a reaction by asking a question. Drives at what the story is about.\nThe chatter answers the question in the headline without talking about the blue line, a model, anything. A reader can see it.\nSimple, precise, direct language.\n\nOne more, same chart.\n\nggplot(offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`)) + \n  geom_point(color=\"grey\") + geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  labs(x=\"Total yards per game\", y=\"Points per game\", title=\"Maryland's offense overperformed\", subtitle=\"The Terps' offense fared better than many given their output.\", caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Derek Willis\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`, label=\"Maryland 2018\"))\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat works here:\n\nStrong verb: overperformed.\nHeadline tells the story. Chatter bolsters it.\nDoesn’t repeat Maryland or Terps\n\nTaking time to sharpen your headlines will make your graphics better."

We did this in the bubble charts example.\n\nlogs %>% \n  group_by(Team, Conference) %>% \n  summarise(\n    TotalPlays = sum(OffensivePlays), \n    TotalYards = sum(OffensiveYards), \n    DefensivePlays = sum(DefPlays), \n    DefensiveYards = sum(DefYards)) %>% \n  mutate(\n    OffensiveYPP = TotalYards/TotalPlays, \n    DefensiveYPP = DefensiveYards/DefensivePlays) -> ypp\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Team'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nTo build the annotations, I want the average for offensive yards per play and defensive yards per play. We’re going to use those as a proxy for quality. If your team averages more yards per play on offense, that’s good. If they average fewer yards per play on defense, that too is good. So that sets up a situation where we have four corners, anchored by good at both and bad at both.

Next, I want to add some text annotations, labeling two corners of my chart (the other two, in my opinion, become obvious). Then, I want to label all the playoff teams. I use geom_text_repel to do that – it’s using the ggrepel library to push the text away from the dots, respective of other labels and other dots. It means you don’t have to move them around so you can read them, or so they don’t cover up the dots.\nThe rest is just adding labels and messing with the theme.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=ypp, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=playoffs, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=5.7, color=\"dark grey\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=5.7, color=\"dark grey\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=7, y=5.5, label=\"Good Offense, Good Defense\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=5, y=6, label=\"Bad Defense, Bad Offense\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=playoffs, aes(x=OffensiveYPP, y=DefensiveYPP, label=Team)) +\n  labs(x=\"Offensive Yards Per Play\", y=\"Defensive Points Per Play\", title=\"All four playoff teams are good\", subtitle=\"Each of the four have above average offenses and defenses.\", caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Derek Willis\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 7),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()\n  )"

    "text": "32.3 Waffle charts require special attention\nFrequently in my classes, students use the waffle charts library quite extensively to make graphics. This is a quick walkthough on how to get a waffle chart into a publication ready state.\n\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nLet’s look at the offensive numbers from the 2021 Maryland v. Illinois football game. Maryland won 20-17, even though the Terps outgained the Illini by 113 yards. You can find the official stats on the NCAA’s website.\nI’m going to make two vectors for each team and record rushing yards and passing yards.\n\nmd <- c(\"Rushing\"=131, \"Passing\"=350, 113)\nil <- c(\"Rushing\"=183, \"Passing\"=185, 0)\n\nSo what does the breakdown of Maryland’s night look like? How balanced was the offense?\nThe waffle library can break this down in a way that’s easier on the eyes than a pie chart. We call the library, add the data, specify the number of rows, give it a title and an x value label, and to clean up a quirk of the library, we’ve got to specify colors.\nADDITIONALLY\nWe can add labels and themes, but you have to be careful. The waffle library is applying it’s own theme, but if we override something they are using in their theme, some things that are hidden come back and make it worse. So here is an example of how to use ggplot’s labs and the theme to make a fully publication ready graphic.\n\nwaffle(md/10, rows = 5, xlab=\"1 square = 10 yards\", colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Maryland vs Illinois on offense\", \n    subtitle=\"The Terps couldn't get much of a running game going.\",\n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | Graphic by Derek Willis\") + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\nBut what if we’re using a waffle iron? And what if we want to change the output size? It gets tougher.\nTruth is, I’m not sure what is going on with the sizing. You can try it and you’ll find that the outputs are … unpredictable.\nThings you need to know about waffle irons:\n\nThey’re a convenience method, but all they’re really doing is executing two waffle charts together. If you don’t apply the theme to both waffle charts, it breaks.\nYou will have to get creative about applying headline and subtitle to the top waffle chart and the caption to the bottom.\nUsing ggsave doesn’t work either. So you’ll have to use R’s pdf output.\n\nHere is a full example. I start with my waffle iron code, but note that each waffle is pretty much a self contained thing. That’s because a waffle iron isn’t really a thing. It’s just a way to group waffles together, so you have to make each waffle individually. My first waffle has the title and subtitle but no x axis labels and the bottom one has not title or subtitle but the axis labels and the caption.\n\niron(\n waffle(\n   md/10, \n   rows = 2, \n   xlab=\"Maryland\",\n   colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")) + \n   labs(\n     title=\"Maryland vs Illinois: By the numbers\", \n     subtitle=\"The Terps couldn't run, the Illini could.\") + \n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n waffle(\n   il/10, \n   rows = 2, \n   xlab=\"Illinois\\n1 square = 10 yards\", \n   colors = c(\"black\", \"red\", \"white\")) + \n   labs(caption=\"Source: NCAA | Graphic by Derek Willis\")\n)"

If you compare the offense to every other offense and how many points they score vs the number of yards they roll up, Maryland actually overperformed.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Derek Willis\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`, label=\"Maryland 2018\"))\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the problem right away – it’s too long and gets cut off. One way to fix this is to put \\n where you think the line break should be. That’s a newline character, so it would add a return there. But with ggtext, you can use simple HTML to style the text, which opens up a lot of options. We can use a  to break the line. The other thing we need to do is in the theme element, change the element_text for plot.subtitle to element_markdown.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_smooth(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Total yards per game\", \n    y=\"Points per game\", \n    title=\"Maryland's overperforming offense\", \n    subtitle=\"The Terps' offense was the strength of the team, having to overcome a defense that often struggled to stop<br/>opponents. If you compare the offense to every other offense and how many points they score vs the number of<br/> yards they roll up, Maryland actually overperformed.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Derek Willis\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`, label=\"Maryland 2018\"))\n\n\n\n\nWith ggtext, there’s a lot more you can do with CSS, like change the color of text, that I don’t recommend. Also, there’s only a few HTML tags that have been implemented. For example, you can’t add links because the a tag hasn’t been added.\nAnother sometimes useful thing you can do is add much more explanation to your axis labels. This is going to be a silly example because “Points per game” is pretty self-explanatory, but roll with it. First, we create an unusually long y axis label, then, in theme, we add some code to axis.title.y.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_smooth(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Total yards per game\", \n    y=\"Points per game is an imperfect metric of offensive efficiency because defenses and special teams score points as well.\", \n    title=\"Maryland's overperforming offense\", \n    subtitle=\"The Terps' offense was the strength of the team, having to overcome a defense that often struggled to stop<br/>opponents. If you compare the offense to every other offense and how many points they score vs the number of<br/> yards they roll up, Maryland actually overperformed.\", \n    caption=\"Source: NCAA | By Derek Willis\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_textbox_simple(\n      orientation = \"left-rotated\",\n      width = grid::unit(2.5, \"in\")\n    )\n    ) +\n  geom_point(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text_repel(data=umd, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`, label=\"Maryland 2018\"))\n\n\n\n\nOne last advanced trick: Adding a text box explainer in the graphic. This should be used in somewhat rare circumstances – you don’t want to pollute your data space with lots of text. If your graphic needs so much explainer text, you should be asking yourself hard questions about if your chart is clearly telling a story.\nTo add a text box explainer, you need to add a geom_textbox to your chart. The code below does that, and also adds a geom_point to anchor the box to a spot.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_smooth(data=offense, aes(x=`Yards/G`, y=`Points/G`), method=lm, se=FALSE) + \n  geom_textbox(\n    aes(x=225, \n        y=50, \n        label=\"Dots above the blue line indicate offenses that scored more points than their yards per game would suggest they should.\", \n        orientation = \"upright\", \n        hjust=0, \n        vjust=1), width = unit(2.8, \"in\")) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=225, y=50), size=2) + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Total yards per game\", \n    y=\"Points per game\", \n    title=\"Maryland's overperforming offense\", \n    subtitle=\"The Terps' offense was the strength of the team, having to overcome a defense that often struggled to stop<br/>opponents.

    "text": "All the way back in Chapter 2, we used Google Sheets and importHTML to get our own data out of a website. For me, that’s a lot of pointing and clicking and copying and pasting. R has a library that can automate the harvesting of data from HTML on the internet. It’s called rvest.\nLet’s grab a simple, basic HTML table from College Football Stats. There’s nothing particularly strange about this table – it’s simply formatted and easy to scrape.\nFirst we’ll need some libraries. We’re going to use a library called rvest, which you can get by running install.packages('rvest') in the console.\nThe rvest package has functions that make fetching, reading and parsing HTML simple. The first thing we need to do is specify a url that we’re going to scrape.\nNow, the most difficult part of scraping data from any website is knowing what exact HTML tag you need to grab. In this case, we want a <table> tag that has all of our data table in it. But how do you tell R which one that is? Well, it’s easy, once you know what to do. But it’s not simple. So I’ve made a short video to show you how to find it.\nWhen you have simple tables, the code is very simple. You create a variable to receive the data, then pass it the url, read the html that was fetched, find the node you need using your XPath value you just copied and you tell rvest that it’s a table.\nWhat we get from this is … not a dataframe. It’s a list with one element in it, which just so happens to be our dataframe. When you get this, the solution is simple: just overwrite the variable you created with the first list element.\nAnd what do we have?\nWe have data, ready for analysis."

What if we want to look at every scoring offense going back several years? The website has them going back to 2009. How can we combine them?\nFirst, we should note, that the data does not have anything in it to indicate what year it comes from. So we’re going to have to add that. And we’re going to have to figure out a way to stack two dataframes on top of each other.\nSo let’s grab 2020.\n\nscoringoffenseurl20 <- \"http://www.cfbstats.com/2020/leader/national/team/offense/split01/category09/sort01.html\"\n\nscoringoffense20 <- scoringoffenseurl20 %>%\n  read_html() %>%\n  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"content\"]/div[2]/table') %>%\n  html_table()\n\nscoringoffense20 <- scoringoffense20[[1]]\n\nFirst, how are we going to know, in the data, which year our data is from? We can use mutate.\n\nscoringoffense20 <- scoringoffense %>% mutate(YEAR = 2020)\n\nError in initialize(...): attempt to use zero-length variable name\n\n\nUh oh. Error. What does it say? It’s … not clear, but a hint is that our first column doesn’t have a name. Each column must be named. If you look at our data in the environment tab in the upper right corner, you’ll see that indeed, the first column has no name. It’s the FBS rank of each team. So we can fix that and mutate in the same step. We’ll do that using rename and since the field doesn’t have a name to rename it, we’ll use a position argument. We’ll say rename column 1 as Rank.\n\nscoringoffense21 <- scoringoffense %>% rename(Rank = 1) %>% mutate(YEAR = 2021)\nscoringoffense20 <- scoringoffense20 %>% rename(Rank = 1) %>% mutate(YEAR = 2020)\n\nAnd now, to combine the two tables together length-wise – we need to make long data – we’ll use a dpylr function called bind_rows. The good thing is bind_rows is simple.\n\ncombined <- bind_rows(scoringoffense21, scoringoffense20)\n\nNote in the environment tab we now have a data frame called combined that has 257 observations – which just so happens to be what 127 from 2020 and 130 from 2021 add up to.\n\nhead(combined)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n   Rank Name               G    TD    FG `1XP` `2XP` Safety Points Point…¹  YEAR\n  <int> <chr>          <int> <int> <int> <int> <int>  <int>  <int>   <dbl> <dbl>\n1     1 Ohio State        13    76    20    76     0      1    594    45.7  2021\n2     2 Western Kentu…    14    79    23    72     2      0    619    44.2  2021\n3     3 Pittsburgh        14    76    17    71     0      1    580    41.4  2021\n4     4 Wake Forest       14    72    23    65     4      0    574    41    2021\n5     5 Coastal Carol…    13    72     9    65     2      2    532    40.9  2021\n6     6 Alabama           15    75    23    71     4      0    598    39.9  2021\n# … with abbreviated variable name ¹​`Points/G`"

But here’s one idea: Don’t try to make it work.\nI’ll explain.\nLet’s try to get season team stats from Sports Reference. If you look at that page, you’ll see the problem right away – the headers span two rows, and they repeat. That’s going to be all kinds of no good. You can’t import that. Dataframes must have names all in one row. If you have two-line headers, you have a problem you have to fix before you can do anything else with it.\nFirst we’ll grab the page.\n\nurl <- \"https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/seasons/2022-school-stats.html\"\n\nNow, similar to our example above, we’ll read the html, use XPath to find the table, and then read that table with a directive passed to it setting the header to FALSE. That tells rvest that there isn’t a header row. Just import it as data.\n\nstats <- url %>%\n  read_html() %>%\n  html_nodes(xpath = '//*[@id=\"basic_school_stats\"]') %>%\n  html_table(header=FALSE)\n\nWhat we get back is a list of one element (similar to above). So let’s pop it out into a data frame.\n\nstats <- stats[[1]]\n\nAnd we’ll take a look at what we have.\n\nhead(stats)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 38\n  X1    X2     X3    X4    X5    X6    X7    X8    X9    X10   X11   X12   X13  \n  <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr> <lgl> <chr> <chr> <lgl> <chr>\n1 \"\"    \"\"     Over… Over… Over… Over… Over… Over… NA    Conf.

We have headers and data mixed together, and our columns are named X1 to X38. Also note: They’re all character fields. Because the headers are interspersed with data, it all gets called character data. So we’ve got to first rename each field.\n\nstats <- stats %>% rename(Rank=X1, School=X2, Games=X3, OverallWins=X4, OverallLosses=X5, WinPct=X6, OverallSRS=X7, OverallSOS=X8, Blank1=X9, ConferenceWins=X10, ConferenceLosses=X11, Blank2=X12, HomeWins=X13, HomeLosses=X14, Blank3=X15, AwayWins=X16, AwayLosses=X17, Blank4=X18, ForPoints=X19, OppPoints=X20, Blank5=X21, Minutes=X22, FieldGoalsMade=X23, FieldGoalsAttempted=X24, FieldGoalPCT=X25, ThreePointMade=X26, ThreePointAttempts=X27, ThreePointPct=X28, FreeThrowsMade=X29, FreeThrowsAttempted=X30, FreeThrowPCT=X31, OffensiveRebounds=X32, TotalRebounds=X33, Assists=X34, Steals=X35, Blocks=X36, Turnovers=X37, PersonalFouls=X38)\n\nNow we have to get rid of those headers interspersed in the data. We can do that with filter that say keep all the stuff that isn’t this.\n\nstats <- stats %>% filter(Rank != \"Rk\" & Games != \"Overall\") \n\nAnd finally, we need to change the file type of all the fields that need it. We’re going to use a clever little trick, which goes like this: We’re going to use mutate_at, which means mutate these fields. The pattern for mutate_at is mutate_at these variables and do this thing to them. But instead of specifying which of 38 variables we’re going to mutate, we’re going to specify the one we don’t want to change, which is the name of the school. And we just want to convert them to numeric, which is simple. Here’s what it looks like:\n\nstats <- stats %>% mutate_at(vars(-School), as.numeric)\n\nOne last thing: Who needs columns called Blank1, Blank2, Blank3, etc?\n\nstats <- stats %>% select(-starts_with(\"Blank\"))\n\nAnd just like that, we have a method for getting up to the minute season stats for every team in Division I.\n\nhead(stats)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 33\n   Rank School      Games Overa…¹ Overa…² WinPct Overa…³ Overa…⁴ Confe…⁵ Confe…⁶\n  <dbl> <chr>       <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n1     1 Abilene Ch…    36      25      11  0.694    2.25   -2.09      11       7\n2     2 Air Force      29      11      18  0.379   -5.67    1.33       4      13\n3     3 Akron NCAA     34      24      10  0.706    0.91   -3.93      14       6\n4     4 Alabama A&M    30      12      18  0.4    -14.4    -8.86      10       8\n5     5 UAB NCAA       35      27       8  0.771   10.9    -0.14      14       4\n6     6 Alabama St…    31      10      21  0.323  -12.0    -5.45       8      10\n# … with 23 more variables: HomeWins <dbl>, HomeLosses <dbl>, AwayWins <dbl>,\n#   AwayLosses <dbl>, ForPoints <dbl>, OppPoints <dbl>, Minutes <dbl>,\n#   FieldGoalsMade <dbl>, FieldGoalsAttempted <dbl>, FieldGoalPCT <dbl>,\n#   ThreePointMade <dbl>, ThreePointAttempts <dbl>, ThreePointPct <dbl>,\n#   FreeThrowsMade <dbl>, FreeThrowsAttempted <dbl>, FreeThrowPCT <dbl>,\n#   OffensiveRebounds <dbl>, TotalRebounds <dbl>, Assists <dbl>, Steals <dbl>,\n#   Blocks <dbl>, Turnovers <dbl>, PersonalFouls <dbl>, and abbreviated …"

    "text": "With the chapter, we learned how to grab one table from one page. But what if you needed more than that? What if you needed hundreds of tables from hundreds of pages? What if you needed to combine one table on one page into a bigger table, but hundreds of times. There’s a way to do this, it just takes patience, a lot of logic, a lot of debugging and, for me, a fair bit of swearing.\nSo what we are after are game by game stats for each college basketball team in America.\nWe can see from this page that each team is linked. If we follow each link, we get a ton of tables. But they aren’t what we need. There’s a link to gamelogs underneath the team names.\nSo we can see from this that we’ve got some problems.\nSo let’s start with that last question first and grab libraries we need.\nFirst things first, we need to grab the url to each team from that first link.\nBut notice first, we don’t want to grab the table. The table doesn’t help us. We need to grab the only link in the table. So we can do that by using the table xpath node, then grabbing the anchor tags in the table, then get only the link out of them (instead of the linked text).\nNotice we now have a list called schools with … 353 elements. That’s the number of teams in college basketball, so we’re off to a good start. Here’s what the fourth element is.\nSo note, that’s the relative path to Alabama A&M’s team page. By relative path, I mean it doesn’t have the root domain. So we need to add that to each request or we’ll get no where.\nSo that’s a problem to note.\nBefore we solve that, let’s just make sure we can get one page and get what we need.\nWe’ll scrape Abilene Christian.\nTo merge all this into one big table, we need to grab the team name and their conference and merge it into the table. But those values come from somewhere else. The scraping works just about the same, but instead of html_table you use html_text.\nSo the first part of this is reading the html of the page so we don’t do that for each element – we just do it once so as to not overwhelm their servers.\nThe second part is we’re grabbing the team name based on it’s location in the page.\nThird: The conference.\nFourth is the table itself, noting to ignore the headers. The last bit fixes the headers, removes the garbage header data from the table, converts the data to numbers, fixes the date and mutates a team and conference value. It looks like a lot, and it took a bit of twiddling to get it done, but it’s no different from what you did for your last homework.\nNow what we’re left with is how do we do this for ALL the teams. We need to send 353 requests to their servers to get each page. And each url is not the one we have – we need to alter it.\nFirst we have to add the root domain to each request. And, each request needs to go to /2019-gamelogs.html instead of /2019.html. If you look at the urls two the page we have and the page we need, that’s all that changes.\nWhat we’re going to use is what is known in programming as a loop. We can loop through a list and have it do something to each element in the loop. And once it’s done, we can move on to the next thing.\nThink of it like a program that will go though a list of your classmates and ask each one of them for their year in school. It will start at one end of the list and move through asking each one “What year in school are you?” and will move on after getting an answer.\nExcept we want to take a url, add something to it, alter it, then request it and grab a bunch of data from it. Once we’re done doing all that, we’ll take all that info and cram it into a bigger dataset and then move on to the next one. Here’s what that looks like:\nThe magic here is in for (i in schools){. What that says is for each iterator in schools – for each school in schools – do what follows each time. So we take the code we wrote for one school and use it for every school.\nThis part:\nlog_url is what changes our school page url to our logs url, and school_url is taking that log url and the root domain and merging them together to create the complete url. Then, page just reads that url we created.\nWhat follows that is taken straight from our example of just doing one.\nThe last bits are using bind_rows to take our data and mash it into a bigger table, over and over and over again until we have them all in a single table. Then, we tell our scraper to wait a few seconds because we don’t want our script to machine gun requests at their server as fast as it can go. That’s a guaranteed way to get them to block scrapers, and could knock them off the internet. Aggressive scrapers aren’t cool. Don’t do it.\nLastly, we write it out to a csv file.\nSo with a little programming knowhow, a little bit of problem solving and the stubbornness not to quit on it, you can get a whole lot of data scattered all over the place with not a lot of code."

To a one, they’ll say they found public data and started blogging about their analysis of it. For nearly every single guest, this is their path into the field. They started messing around with data in a toolset, found something interesting and wrote a post about what they found and how they found it. Other analysts noticed it, or a hiring manager liked what they read, and the rest is history, as they say.\nSo, let’s do that. Let’s get you a blog so you can post your work.\nHere’s our requirements:"

    "text": "35.1 Setup\nWith those requirements in mind, we’re going to use a library called Blogdown, which creates blog posts from R Markdown files, similar to what you’ve been working with in this book.\nIt installs how you think it should. Go into the console and run this:\n\ninstall.packages('blogdown') \n\nAfter that, run this:\n\nblogdown::install_hugo()\n\nAfter that, we’re ready to start making a blog. To do that, go to File > New Project and select New Directory (or Version Control if you know what you’re doing).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Project Type view, you may have to scroll down to find “Website using blogdown” but that’s your choice. Mine will probably look different than yours, but below is what the line you’re looking for looks like.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we’ve come to our first decision point.\nFirst, name the directory you’re going to put this into. Keep it simple. Blog is fine. Then decide where on your computer you’re going to put it. Put it somewhere you’re going to remember. Don’t put it on your Desktop. Put it in a folder. Remember what folder because you’re going to need this later.\nNow for the big decision: What theme to use. There’s four choices, but the default theme is the most fully documented. If you want to use another theme, you’ll be better off creating two projects: the one you’re going to publish, and the lithium theme you can steal stuff from.\nHere’s the easiest themes to work with:\n\nyihui/hugo-lithium\nyihui/hugo-prose\nyihui/hugo-ivy\nyihui/hugo-xmin\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you hit Create Project, you should get an R Studio screen. You might have a file open called config.yaml. If you don’t, open it (you can use the files pane in the bottom right). This file will look different depending on which theme you used. This configuration file needs to have a few things in it. This is the config.yaml for my website, but you should use it as a guide for what yours will need:\nbaseurl: https://dwillis.github.io/\nlanguageCode: en-us\ntitle: Derek Willis' GitHub Site\ntheme: hugo-lithium\ngoogleAnalytics: ''\ndisqusShortname: ''\n\nignoreFiles:\n  - \\.Rmd$\n  - \\.Rmarkdown$\n  - _cache$\n  - \\.knit\\.md$\n  - \\.utf8\\.md$\npermalinks:\n  post: /:year/:month/:day/:slug/\nmenu:\n  main:\n    - name: About\n      url: /about/\n    - name: GitHub\n      url: https://github.com/dwillis\n    - name: Twitter\n      url: https://twitter.com/derekwillis\nparams:\n  \n  MathJaxCDN: //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs\n  MathJaxVersion: 2.7.5\n  description: Tools and teaching materials made by Derek Willis of the University of Maryland\n  favicon: favicon.ico\n  highlightjsCDN: //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs\n  highlightjsLang:\n    - r\n    - yaml\n  highlightjsTheme: GitHub\n  highlightjsVersion: 9.12.0\n  logo:\n    alt: Logo\n    height: 50\n    url: logo.png\n    width: 50\nThe top parts are generally filled in regardless of the theme. You’ll obviously want to change the base url and the title. For Google Analytics, you’ll add your tracking id there if and when you want to set that up. Leave ignorefiles and permalinks alone. For your menu – that is up to you. If someone wanting to hire you came across your site, what would you include here? Another thing to change? The description. It will be the text that appears below the name in Google."

R Markdown are the ones with the code.\nLet’s start with a simple Markdown file – the homepage of the site. To edit files, use the Files tab. All of the material you’ll be editing is in the content folder.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start with editing the about.md file. Some templates also have a _index.md file, which is the static part of the homepage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the top, you will have something called a yaml header, which are things that set up the page. They are quite simple to figure out. Here’s the yaml header the Ivy theme generates. Obviously, I need to change the author, the date and the title for my site.\n---\nauthor: Yihui Xie\ndate: \"2017-08-06\"\ntitle: About Hugo Ivy\n---\nChange yours, then change the text below the yaml header, and then save it.

    "text": "35.4 Creating a new post in R Markdown\nYou’ll notice in your content folder that there is a folder called post, and in there are multiple posts. Depending on your theme, you might just have folders in post, and you might have some markdown files. They work mostly the same way.\nThe magic here is how you name them. You’ll remember from config.yaml that we have a post url format that goes post / year / month / day / slug. The reason for that is that urls matter for Google. Clean urls with meaningful information in them rank higher.\nSo in post, you’ll see the folders are named similarly – a date separated by dashes followed by a slug – the headline of your post in all lower case with dashes instead of spaces. So if I were writing a post called “I love sports data”, the slug version of that would be i-love-sports-data. If I were writing it on December 15, which I am, my folder would be 2020-12-15-i-love-sports-data.\nNOTE: CAPITALIZATION MATTERS. AS IN, DON’T. You don’t see capitals in URLs, so don’t use them.\nSo let’s create a post.\nThe easiest way to do this is to click Addins > New Post. You need to fill out four things on the page: The Title, Author, Date (if you’re changing it) and the Format. Be smart about the title – don’t but TEST TEST TEST or TITLE HERE because it will build with that and it’s hard to change later. Give some thought to the headline on your post before you hit done.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you’re done, hit Done and an RMarkdown file will appear, just as you have been using throughout this book.\nThe first thing you’ll see is the yaml header. Typically, if we’ve filled out the previous screen correctly, we should be good. But if you need to fix something, you can do it here.\n---\ntitle: \"Sports Data Analysis and Visualization\"\nauthor: \"Matt Waite\"\ndate: 2019-07-29T21:13:14-05:00\ncategories: [\"Books\"]\ntags: [\"R\", \"data\", \"sports\"]\n---\nBelow the yaml header?

    "text": "35.5 Publishing your site\nBlogdown is built on top of the Hugo static site generator. What that means is that Blogdown is going to take your Markdown files and create static html. What does static html mean? It means there’s no server creating it on the fly – that’s called dynamic html – so this can be hosted on the simplest of servers.\nPublishing takes a lot of steps to get set up, but once it is, it’s easy.\nStep 1: Get a GitHub account\nGo to GitHub and sign up for an account. NOTE: Your username will be part of your website address, and you could potentially be sending this to employers. I’m sure blaze420rryday has been your handle since middle school, but do you want an employer to see that? My GitHub user name is mattwaite. See what I’m getting at here?\nStep 2: Set up your website repository\nFor the low low price of nothing, GitHub will host a website for you, and we are going to take them up on that bargain. There’s several tricks to getting this to work, but none of them are hard. They just require you to be specific.\nTo start, you can click on the plus sign in the top right corner or hit the green new button, depending on what your page looks like vs mine (I’m reasonably active GitHub user, so mine will look different from yours).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the create a new repository page, the name of your respository needs to follow this pattern: yourusernamehere.github.io where yourusernamehere is … your username. So my site is mattwaite.github.io because my username is mattwaite. This is why you do not want to select swaggylovedoctor as your username, no matter how attached to it you are. Your employment chances are zero with something dumb like that.\nAfter you’ve named the repository correctly, leave it public, check add .gitignore, and then select a gitignore template. Type R into the search, select it, and the create repository button will become active. Click create repository.\nStep 3:\nDon’t close your GitHub window.\nIn a new tab, download the GitHub Desktop App and install it.\nGitHub is a version control system and a social network mixed together. Version control is like Track Changes in Word, but on steroids. If you plan on a career in analytics or data science, GitHub is a skill you will have to learn, but it’s beyond the scope of this book.\nTo work around this, we’re going to use GitHub Desktop to manage our interactions with GitHub. Open GitHub Desktop and log into your GitHub account in the app.\nTo get your repository into GitHub Desktop, go back to your tab with your GitHub repository in it. Find the Code button and click it. Click on the Open With GitHub Desktop button.\nIn the window that pops up, we need to set the Local Path. This path needs to be the same place your blog project is located. Click the Choose button and navigate to where your blog project is located. Then, just click Clone.\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4:\nLet’s get your site on the internet.\nSwitch back to your blog project in R Studio. We’re going to output your site and upload it to GitHub.\nTo do this, we need to change config.yaml. We need to tell your website project that you want to publish to your GitHub folder, not the default.\nOpen config.yaml in your blog project. Near the top, above ignoreFiles, add this line, replacing yourusername with … your user name. This says publish to your GitHub project that you put in the same folder as your blog project:\npublishDir: \"../yourusername.github.io\"\nSave config.yaml.\nOnce you are ready to build your site, you need to click on the Build tab and then on Build Website.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf it worked, you should see output in the window that looks something like this (yours will be different from mine):\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5\nNow go to the GitHub Desktop App. You should see something that looks like this, though yours will be different from mine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is where you will commit files to your repository. GitHub is a two-step process for getting files from your computer to GitHub. The first is committing the files. To do that, add a message in the box next to your avatar (where it says update index.html in the screenshot above). Then click Commit to main (mine says master because it’s an older repository before GitHub switched to using main by default). The second step is to push it to GitHub. You do that on the screen that appears after you have committed your files. It should say you have No Local Changes, which is good because you sent them to GitHub. Now click Push origin.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a few minutes, you should be able to go to username.github.io in a browser and you’ll see your site. Here’s mine."

But maybe wait to do that until you read the whole section.\nAfter installations, we can load it up.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cfbfastR)\n\nYou might be thinking, “Oh wow, I can get play by play data for college football. Let’s look at what are the five most heartbreaking plays of last year’s Maryland season.” Because what better way to determine doom than by looking at the steepest drop-off in win probability, which is included in the data.\nGreat idea. Let’s do it. You’ll need to make sure that your API key has been added to your environment.\nThe first thing to do is read the documentation. You’ll see that you can request data for each week. For example, here’s week 2, which is actually Maryland’s third game (the week 0 game is lumped in with week 1).\n\nmaryland <- cfbd_pbp_data(\n 2021,\n  week=2, \n  season_type = \"regular\",\n  team = \"Maryland\",\n  epa_wpa = TRUE,\n)\n\n• 14:39:00 | Start processing of 1 game...\n\n\nThere’s not an easy way to get all of a single team’s games. A way to do it that’s not very pretty but it works is like this:\n\nwk1 <- cfbd_pbp_data(2021, week=1, season_type = \"regular\", team = \"Maryland\", epa_wpa = TRUE)\nSys.sleep(2)\nwk2 <- cfbd_pbp_data(2021, week=2, season_type = \"regular\", team = \"Maryland\", epa_wpa = TRUE)\nSys.sleep(2)\nwk3 <- cfbd_pbp_data(2021, week=3, season_type = \"regular\", team = \"Maryland\", epa_wpa = TRUE)\nSys.sleep(2)\nwk4 <- cfbd_pbp_data(2021, week=4, season_type = \"regular\", team = \"Maryland\", epa_wpa = TRUE)\nSys.sleep(2)\nwk5 <- cfbd_pbp_data(2021, week=5, season_type = \"regular\", team = \"Maryland\", epa_wpa = TRUE)\nSys.sleep(2)\nwk6 <- cfbd_pbp_data(2021, week=6, season_type = \"regular\", team = \"Maryland\", epa_wpa = TRUE)\nSys.sleep(2)\nwk8 <- cfbd_pbp_data(2021, week=8, season_type = \"regular\", team = \"Maryland\", epa_wpa = TRUE)\nSys.sleep(2)\nwk9 <- cfbd_pbp_data(2021, week=9, season_type = \"regular\", team = \"Maryland\", epa_wpa = TRUE)\nSys.sleep(2)\nwk10 <- cfbd_pbp_data(2021, week=10, season_type = \"regular\", team = \"Maryland\", epa_wpa = TRUE)\nSys.sleep(2)\nwk11 <- cfbd_pbp_data(2021, week=11, season_type = \"regular\", team = \"Maryland\", epa_wpa = TRUE)\nSys.sleep(2)\nwk12 <- cfbd_pbp_data(2021, week=12, season_type = \"regular\", team = \"Maryland\", epa_wpa = TRUE)\n\numplays <- bind_rows(wk1, wk2, wk3, wk4, wk5, wk6, wk8, wk9, wk10, wk11, wk12)\n\nThe sys.sleep bits just pauses for two seconds before running the next block. Since we’re requesting data from someone else’s computer, we want to be kind. Week 7 was a bye week for Maryland, so if you request it, you’ll get an empty request and a warning. The bind_rows parts puts all the dataframes into a single dataframe.\nNow you’re ready to look at heartbreak. How do we define heartbreak? How about like this: you first have to lose the game, it comes in the third or fourth quarter, it involves a play (i.e. not a timeout), and it results in the biggest drop in win probability.\n\numplays %>% \n  filter(pos_team == \"Maryland\" & wk > 4 & play_type != \"Timeout\") %>% \n  filter(period == 3 | period == 4) %>% \n  mutate(HeartbreakLevel = wp_before - wp_after) %>% \n  arrange(desc(HeartbreakLevel)) %>% \n  top_n(5, wt=HeartbreakLevel) %>%\n  select(period, clock.minutes, def_pos_team, play_type, play_text)\n\n── play-by-play data from CollegeFootballData.com ──────────── cfbfastR 1.9.0 ──\n\n\nℹ Data updated: 2022-09-04 14:39:04 EDT\n\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  period clock.minutes def_pos_team   play_type                  play_text      \n   <int>         <int> <chr>          <chr>                      <chr>          \n1      3             0 Penn State     Rush                       Challen Faamat…\n2      3            12 Michigan State Interception Return        Taulia Tagovai…\n3      3            15 Penn State     Pass Incompletion          Taulia Tagovai…\n4      3             4 Penn State     Fumble Recovery (Opponent) Taulia Tagovai…\n5      4            11 Penn State     Pass Incompletion          Taulia Tagovai…\n\n\nThe most heartbreaking play of the season?

Finding out who Maryland’s top 10 single-season scoring leaders are is a matter of grouping, summing and filtering.\n\nwbb_player_box %>% \n  filter(team_short_display_name == \"Maryland\") %>% \n  group_by(athlete_display_name, season) %>% \n  summarise(totalPoints = sum(as.numeric(pts))) %>% \n  arrange(desc(totalPoints)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  top_n(10, wt=totalPoints)\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 3\n   athlete_display_name season totalPoints\n   <chr>                 <int>       <dbl>\n 1 Kaila Charles          2018         610\n 2 Angel Reese            2022         569\n 3 Kaila Charles          2019         557\n 4 Ashley Owusu           2021         518\n 5 Diamond Miller         2021         501\n 6 Taylor Mikesell        2019         448\n 7 Kaila Charles          2020         433\n 8 Stephanie Jones        2019         425\n 9 Ashley Owusu           2022         385\n10 Chloe Bibby            2021         382\n11 Chloe Bibby            2022         382\n\n\nThis just in: Kaila Charles is good at basketball."
