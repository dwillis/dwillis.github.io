Moore is recommending an increase in Maryland's capital gains tax and an increase in the personal income tax. In each instance, the increase will only be for higher levels of income. Of course, such a tax will primarily affect those with the largest stake in the state's economy.In contrast, Canada's new prime minister recently announced he will not propose or support an increase in Canada's capital gains tax. While this may not seem especially perspicacious since the Canadian capital gains rate is already at 50%, it certainly does recognize a limit to what is economically sensible. It's wishful thinking but would be nice, therefore, if Canada's experience helped educate Gov. Moore and Maryland about the pitfalls of pushing the private sector too far.\nART CECIL\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Meeting, discussions at Cambridge YMCA heat up\n\n June 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jim Johnson jjohnson@chespub.com | Section: Columns \n \n 1318\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The gym was hot. Not unbearably hot, but close enough.Members of the Pauline F. and W. David Robbins Family YMCA in Cambridge filed into the gym on a blistering hot day to hear about plans for a new YMCA from the Y's leadership.\n\"Welcome to the world's largest sauna,\" somebody said as people picked up a bottle of water the Y provided for attendees.\nHundreds attended. Many of them were hot — not just because of the heat in the gym — but because they had heard about plans to move the YMCA to the proposed Cambridge Harbor site that is being developed by Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc.\nThey liked the Y right where it is on Talbot Avenue in Cambridge.\nAt the microphone was Robbie Gill. Much of the crowd's heat was directed at Gill, who is the CEO of the YMCA of the Chesapeake, the organization that oversees and runs not just the Cambridge Y but the 11 Eastern Shore YMCAs from Elkton in Cecil County to Pokomoke City and Salsibury on the Lower Shore.\nI must say, Gill was cool. He was chill. People were angry, and they let him know it. I didn't see him sweating. He patiently answered questions after the crowd moved from the hot gym to the better air-conditioned lobby.\nLet's say that a good part of the problem was self-inflicted.\nThe meeting was held less than two weeks after an email was sent out by the YMCA of the Chesapeake that led people to believe the organization had reached a deal with Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. to build a new YMCA on the Cambridge Harbor site.\nBoth Gill and CWDI Executive Director Matt Leonard told the Star Democrat after that email landed in members in boxes that there is no such deal to build on Cambridge Harbor at this time.\nThe YMCA is advocating the need to build a new YMCA, Gill said in his interview with Star Democrat reporter Maggie Trovato. He said the existing site is not sustainable over the next two decades and can't provide certain programs, amenities and services.\nHe repeated that at the meeting with Cambridge Y members last Tuesday. I am not sure he changed many minds at the meeting.\nGill gave a presentation on a market study that tested three different sites for a new Cambridge YMCA facility. Two representatives from Triangle2, the firm that completed the market study, presented with Gill.\nThe three sites tested in the market study were the current YMCA location on Talbot Avenue near Gerry Boyle Park, Cambridge Harbor and a parcel on the corner of Maple Dam Road and Route 16, which is near Cambridge-South Dorchester High School.\nTriangle2 CEO Lori Swann said 814 households were interviewed for the market study.\nSwann said the current site and Maple Dam Road site did not test as well as the Cambridge Harbor site did.\nAccording to the presentation, 73% of the interviewed county residents that were interested in joining the YMCA would be \"very likely\" to participate in a YMCA at Cambridge Harbor. The presentation showed that 61% felt that way about the current location and 42% felt that way about the Maple Dam Road site.\nGill said the market study made it clear that the community is in need of amenities that the current facility cannot provide.\nDuring the question and answer portion of the meeting, member Phil Reed said his impression from the meeting was that Gill and the YMCA are sold on the waterfront site.\nKathy Abend, who has been a member of the YMCA for several years, said in an interview that she didn't think Gill seemed open to rebuilding on the current site.\n\"He was shutting this down,\" she said.\nFor the record, my wife and I are members of the Cambridge YMCA and work out there daily. We walk from our home to the facility, which we would not be able to do if the Y moved to Cambridge Harbor.\nWith that said, there are good reasons to build a new facility, and statistics from Y's elsewhere on the Eastern Shore support the contention that new facilities result in increased membership. Gill repeatedly brought up the experience in Chestertown, where a new facility resulted in a huge increase in membership, far exceeding projections when that project was started.\nGill also mentioned donors who have pledged the millions of dollars it will take to construct a new facility in Cambridge. Donor dollars are essential to a successful project..\nPart of the problem the YMCA faces is its association with Cambridge Waterfront Development Inc. That organization has been shrouded in secrecy, secrecy that worries many in Cambridge that deals made behind closed doors may not be in the best interest of the town and its tax-paying residents.\nWhile CWDI has shown more openness since Angie Hengst became president of the board this year, there is wariness dealing with the organization. You could see that wariness in the questions asked at the Cambridge Y meeting last week.\nProbably the biggest fear — which may be unfounded but is still a fear — is that a backroom deal has been reached between the two organizations for the development of the Talbot Avenue YMCA property following a move of the facility to Cambridge Harbor.\n\"There has not been talk of a deal with the YMCA,\" CWDI Executive Director Matt Leonard said in an interview with reporter Maggie Trovato earlier this month, adding that the two groups do have conversations from time to time about the YMCA's interest in being a part of the project to develop space along the Choptank River.\nLeonard said CWDI has had those kinds of conversations with multiple respondents of a July 2022 request for proposals. The YMCA was one of the respondents to that request.\nThe June 7 email the YMCA sent out included a \"facility update\" about banners the organization is replacing at its current Cambridge location on Talbot Avenue.\n\"As we work to highlight all the positives that come with building a new Robbins Family Y at Cambridge Harbor, we wanted to give you a sneak peak of the new banners,\" the email reads.\nAfter the email was sent out, people on social media shared concerns about the YMCA's plans. Cambridge Association of Neighborhoods President Chuck McFadden said in an interview that when he saw the email, he was \"taken aback,\" and he said the news was \"buried\" in an email about banners.\nGill, who has received emails and phone calls from concerned residents since the email went out, said the YMCA is advocating the need to build a new YMCA. He said the existing site is not sustainable over the next two decades and can't provide certain programs, amenities and services.\n\"We are trying to help frame a narrative because, right now, you have other people that are framing narratives that are just wrong,\" he said.\nMy opinion: I think the YMCA of Chesapeake should look closer at building new facilities on the existing site. In previous communities where I have been an editor, I have seen voters defeat bonds for new school buildings but then come back and approve bonds for projects where additions were built on to existing buildings.\nThe existing Cambridge YMCA is on 7 acres and offers space for sports fields and community gardens. Those would not be available with a move to Cambridge Harbor.\nAt the same time, a Cambridge Harbor location would be closer to U.S. Route 50 and would attract members from North Dorchester County and areas east of Cambridge, members who would not be interested in the current location deep in town.\nI think either location with added amenities would attract members. It would be easier to build on a new location while keeping the existing facility operational, but with planning, the same thing could be accomplished at the existing location.\nMembers need to keep an open mind about a Cambridge Harbor location. At the same time, YMCA leaders need to listen to the concerns of its existing membership.\nJim Johnson is the executive editor of The Star Democrat. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Nothing more difficult than taking lead on change\n\n February 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 771\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Well before and since his swearing in on Jan. 20, President Trump has been moving aggressively to secure Senate approval of a team of cabinet and sub-cabinet members to implement his Make America Great Again agenda.To date he has achieved significant, but not yet universal, success on those approvals.\nAs I write this there are at least three of his nominations where final Senate approval is increasingly likely but not certain.\nThey are are Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of Health and Human Services, Kash Patel for FBI director, and Tulsi Gabbard for national intelligence director.\nEarlier last month Trump's nomination of Pete Hegseth to serve as secretary of Defense was approved in the Senate by the narrowest of margins.\nFollowing contentious committee hearings on his background and competence, Hegseth was confirmed only after Vice President JD Vance broke a 50-50 tie vote with a \"yes\" vote for him.\nIf any of the pending Trump nominations fail to receive full Senate approval it will be the first time since 1925 when a Republican controlled Senate rejected a Republican president's cabinet nomination. The president then was Calvin Coolidge and the failed nominee was Charles Warren for attorney general.\nTrump's immediate Democratic predecessors — Barack Obama and Joe Biden had all their cabinet nominations approved by the Senate. In both cases there were Democratic majorities in the Senate and some of their more controversial nominations were withdrawn from consideration before full Senate consideration of their nominations.\nThe reasons for resistance to Trump are not surprising.\nOver 500 years ago political observer and philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli wrote the following timeless observation on change:\n\"It must be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them.\"\nIn 2024 Trump ran and won on a change platform and his commitment to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things in Washington.\nThat is similar to the goal that former President Obama expressed when he first ran for the presidency.\nEarly and often on the campaign trail Obama said, \"Washington is broken. My whole campaign has been premised from the start on the idea that we have to fundamentally change how Washington works.\"\nAfter the election to his first term, Obama said with confidence that he had not miscalculated how difficult it would be to change Washington.\nHe said, \"I didn't overpromise. And I didn't underestimate how tough this was gonna be.\"\nAfter four years in office and his election to a second term Obama acknowledged with a combination of frustration, regret and self-reflection, that he had in fact miscalculated and underestimated how hard making changes was going to be.\nHe said \"I'm the first one to confess that the spirit that I brought to Washington, that I wanted to see instituted, where we weren't constantly in a political slugfest … I haven't fully accomplished that. Haven't even come close in some instances. And, you know, if you ask me what's my biggest disappointment [it] is that we haven't changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked.\"\nTime will tell if Donald Trump acknowledges and says much the same thing after the end of his second term.\nThe first test of success or failure for Trump will occur in less than two years.\nIn November 2026, all the seats in the House of Representatives and one third of the seats in the Senate will be up for election.\nHistorically, but not always, these elections are largely a referendum on a president's performance and agenda.\nIf the Republicans do lose control of the House or the Senate in 2026, any unapproved elements of Trump's MAGA agenda will likely be stalled, if not stopped completely.\nConversely, if that does not occur, the odds for success for Trump in continuing to advance his MAGA agenda are greatly increased.\nIt also increases the odds for Vice President Vance securing the Republican nomination for and winning the election as president in 2028.\nGoing forward, only one thing is certain.\nEither way, we will soon be better able to affirm or challenge the thinking that in the political world, pursuing real change is often an exercise in futility, no matter who is elected president. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

No matter. Nothing stopped the world's No. 1 player on his way to a 7-under 64 to build a one-shot lead going into the weekend.Scheffler made eight birdies on another wild afternoon of weather at Royal Portrush, and his 15-foot birdie attempt on the 18th stopped inches short for another.\nThe result was a one-shot lead over former U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick, who made four straight birdies to start the back nine until he cooled on the home stretch and had to settle for a 66.\nThe rain was heavy at times but never lasted long. The wind was breezy but never at strength that can cause fits. The scoring was lower, nearly two shots easier than the opening round.\nExcept for a few chasers, Scheffler made it look like it wasn't enough.\nHe was at 10-under 132 as he chases the third leg of the career Grand Slam, having won the PGA Championship by five shots in May.\nBrian Harman got the best of the weather — surprising sunshine — and took dead aim in his hunt for another claret jug. Harman played bogey-free for a 64 that left him only two shots behind, along with Li Haotong of China, who had a 67.\nEveryone else was five shots behind or more.\nThat includes Rory McIlroy, who went around Royal Portrush in his native Northern Ireland with plenty of cheers but only a few roars. McIlroy had a 69 but lost a lot of ground because of Scheffler, Fitzpatrick and Harman.\nHe started the second round just three shots behind. He goes into the weekend seven shots behind the top-ranked player in the world.\nFitzpatrick was at his lowest point just four months ago when he changed his caddie and coach and began pulling himself up. And now he takes that into the weekend against Scheffler.\n\"He's going to have the expectation to go out and dominate. He's an exceptional player. He's world No. 1, and we're seeing Tiger-like stuff,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I think the pressure is for him to win the golf tournament. For me, obviously I hope I'm going to have some more home support than him, but it's an exciting position for me to be in given where I was earlier this year.\"\nFitzpatrick was rolling along until a pair of short putts he missed, from 5 feet for par on the 14th and from 3 feet for birdie on the 17th. Even so, he holed a 25-foot par putt on the final hole and assured him being in the last group at 9-under 133.\nScheffler was sharp from the start. He hit eight of the 14 fairways — compared with three in the opening round — though his misses never left him too badly out of position. But he is seeing the breaks on smoother Portrush greens, and he looks confident as ever.\nNone of his eight birdies were closer than 7 feet. Five of them were in the 10-foot range and then he threw in a 35-foot birdie on the sixth. His lone bogey came on a drive into deep grass on the 11th that kept him from reaching the green.\nThe statistics led to a shrug.\n\"Overall, I'm hitting the ball solid,\" Scheffler said. \"The tournament is only halfway done. I got off to a good start.\"\nHarman was called the \"Butcher of Hoylake\" when he won the claret jug at Royal Liverpool two years ago because the British press was fascinated by the Georgia native's love for hunting. Now it's about his golf, and it was superb.\nHarman played bogey-free, only once having to stress for par as Royal Portrush allowed for some good scoring in weather that again did not live up to its expectation.\nNot that anyone was complaining. Temperatures were warm, at least by Irish standards. The breeze was noticeable without being overly punishing.\n\"They're very different golf courses, but the golf is similar,\" Harman said. \"You've got to be able to flight your golf ball. You've got to know how far everything's going. Then you can't get frustrated. You're going to end up in funny spots where it doesn't seem fair, and you just have to kind of outlast that stuff.\"\nThe group at 5-under 137 included Harris English (70), Harman's former teammate at Georgia; Tyrrell Hatton of England (69) and Chris Gotterup (65), who wasn't even planning to be at Royal Portrush until winning the Scottish Open last week.\nAlso still around is Bryson DeChambeau, who made a 13-shot improvement from the first round with a 65. Still, he was 11 shots behind.\nMcIlroy wasn't at his best in the opening round and was pleased to be only three behind. Now he has a real mountain to climb. But at least he's still playing, unlike in 2019 at Royal Portrush when he shot 79 and then had a terrific rally only to miss the cut by one shot.\n\"I didn't have this opportunity six years ago, so to play an extra two days in this atmosphere in front of these crowds, I'm very excited for that,\" McIlroy said. \"I feel like my game's definitely good enough to make a run.\"\nThat was before Scheffler began to run away from so many except a small collection of challengers. But this is links golf. And this is the Emerald Isle, where the weather seems to have a mind of its own.\nStill, Scheffler has gone 10 tournaments without finishing out of the top 10 and would appear to present a challenge every bit as daunting as Royal Portrush. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Participants will strengthen their awareness around the topic of suicide prevention, and learn how to reduce suicide risks, leaving attendees with the hope, readiness, and strategies to make a difference in their community.Moon will share his invaluable experience in averting crisis points before suicidality. He is a clinical psychologist with a career focus on trauma, suicide prevention, and education, and is currently the senior advisor for partnerships, engagement and education for the Department of Defense Suicide Prevention Office. He will share insights into national, state and local mental health data, specifically how suicide impacts specific groups, including veterans, first responders, LGBTQ+ populations, and youth.In addition, he will outline the pivotal role each one of us plays in suicide prevention, offering practical strategies for recognizing signs of struggle and responding effectively.Moon will share how to foster an environment of safety for those in your circle to prevent suicide and support those you care about.The month of September is No Matter WhatYou Matter Suicide Prevention Month and For All Seasons urges all citizens to actively work toward the prevention of suicide and to reach out to one another and ask - \"Are you OK?\" listen - without judgment, and share - vital resources to promote an inclusive and mentally healthy community.In the U.S., suicide is the second leading cause of death for people ages 10 to 14 and 25-34.In Maryland, suicide is the third leading cause of death for 10 to 34-year-olds. In 2021, 1 in 5 Maryland Mid-Shore teens ages 14 to 17 attempted suicide at least once.These statistics are staggering, and these deaths are often preventable.Checking in with someone could help save a life. If someone you know is showing signs of depression, withdrawal or unusual behavior, take time to check-in. Reach out to your circle of friends and family. Be attentive to those whom you have concerns about, and connect them to resources. There are proven treatments to help those with suicidal thoughts and behaviors.Someone experiencing a crisis may not recognize that suicidal thoughts are often temporary, and with professional support, hope and healing are within their reach.Ask: \"Are you OK? Are you having suicidal thoughts?\" Be direct and compassionate.Research shows that asking this question will not put the idea into someone's mind.Share: \"You are not alone. Help is available.\" Connect them to services.For All Seasons is just a phone call away.Listen: You don't need to have all the answers. Be fully present without judgment. Allow the person to share their story.Most importantly, if you need suicide prevention resources and a step-by-step conversation guide visit: NoMatterWhatYouMatter.org.

    "content": "‘A gem’: State and local leaders celebrate Port Street Commons project\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 596\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A multi-use property bringing affordable housing and behavioral health services to Easton is officially complete.Port Street Commons, a 24,000-square-foot project led by The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, celebrated the end of construction with a ribbon-cutting ceremony that included local and state officials. The space houses nine apartment units as well as a headquarters for The Arc, complete with offices and a behavioral health suite.\nSpeaking to more than 100 attendees Thursday morning, The Arc President and CEO Jonathon Rondeau said the organization is \"building a future where equity and inclusion are the norm.\"\n\"There will be people whose lives change within these walls because of the services they receive, the connections they make, the housing they can afford,\" Rondeau said.\nThe $11 million project, financed through a capital campaign, received $2.5 million in investment from the state and $750,000 in federal funding, Rondeau said. Chesapeake Neighbors, a housing subsidiary of The Arc, held a lottery in September for potential tenants that fell within the income requirements, with more than 250 people entering.\nThere are seven two-bedroom units and two three-bedroom units, all of them featuring free Wi-Fi and appliances. Two of the first-floor units are tailored to accommodate tenants with disabilities.\nMembers of the Easton Town Council and Talbot County Council, along with Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico), attended Thursday's ceremony.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook said the project is a fit for the town's goal to revitalize the area next to the Tred Avon River. She noted Port Street Commons is the first project to fall under the town's mixed-use waterfront zoning.\n\"We're eager to encourage mixed-use facilities such as this, allowing for exciting new businesses in tandem with more affordable housing, both of which are critical for growth in our community,\" she said.\nThe site at 480 Port Street was identified in July 2021, and construction began just under two years later. In an interview, Rondeau said the quick timeline helps The Arc fulfill the community's immediate housing needs, adding that the town was a crucial partner.\n\"There's a lot of development happening here in Easton,\" Rondeau said. \"It's a small town, only so many inspectors and things like that. The town has been great. They've really worked with us to help meet those timelines when we had a problem.\"\nRondeau said four families who were randomly drawn have been confirmed, with the first of those moving in Dec. 2. All nine apartments should be occupied by March, he said.\nJulia Glanz, deputy secretary of the Maryland Department of Housing & Community Development, and Carol Beatty, secretary of the Maryland Department of Disabilities, both complimented the housing project during the ceremony.\nBeatty said the apartments tackle \"one of the most common concerns\" she hears from Marylanders with disabilities — a lack of accessible housing that is also affordable.\nGlanz was excited about the project and hopes it can be an example for other mixed-use housing endeavors.\n\"It is, I think, a gem across the state,\" Glanz said in an interview. \" … From what I've seen in the last year and a half, this is very unique. And it's bringing so many different facets of life into one space.\"\nThe deputy secretary noted that the House Expansion and Affordability Act of 2024, which encourages higher-density affordable housing projects, reduces government barriers. However, Port Street Commons completed most of its three-and-a-half year turnaround before that act was passed.\n\"The Arc being able to do that without that legislation … is a testament to the community effort here in Easton and Talbot County, which we don't see everywhere,\" Glanz said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

How long was he on \"The X-Files\"?A: The actor's run as FBI Agent Fox Mulder began in 1993, and he has said that he didn't expect the Fox series (now repeating on Comet) to last as long as it did, nor to be as popular as it became. His regular weekly run on the show went through the seventh season, when headlines were made by a lawsuit Duchovny filed against 20th Century Fox Television, alleging that it sold rights to repeats of the show to Fox-affiliated stations for less than they were worth thus costing him some profits.The suit was settled, but Duchovny's contract for the show was up, so he left as a full-time cast member (with Robert Patrick assuming the role of a Mulder surrogate, John Doggett). However, Duchovny returned for part of the eighth season, with the explanation that Mulder had been abducted by aliens.He also came back for the presumed series finale in Season 9, but as it turned out, he wasn't done with the show yet.Fox gave \"The X-Files\" revivals as a limited-run program in 2016 and 2018, which were deemed to be the 10th and 11th seasons of the show. Series creator-producer Chris Carter has inferred that there are more stories in that universe to be told, but any discussions of a continuation of the franchise haven't come to fruition. The show also yielded two theatrical films in which Duchovny played Mulder (opposite Gillian Anderson's Agent Dana Scully), \"The X-Files: Fight the Future\" (1998) and \"The X-Files: I Want to Believe\" (2008). \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

For example, I have seen many road signs claiming \"Slow Children Playing.\" Presumably the quick children are at home studying. Also open to misinterpretation was this sign in Northern Ireland: \"If you find the service in this cafe unsatisfactory, you should see Mr. Wilson the manager.\" The correct play in today's deal should be crystal clear to an expert.After a straightforward auction to four hearts, West leads the club king. How should South plan the play?Declarer has nine top tricks: six hearts, two diamonds and one club. If East has the spade ace, everything will be smooth sailing, but is that likely? West made a two-level vulnerable overcall.Surely he has the spade ace.The next thought is to play three rounds of diamonds, hoping both that they break 3-3 and that West has to win the third round. That is a faint hope against defenders with any acumen.The only way to benefit from a 3-3 diamond break is not to lose a diamond trick. South achieved this by calmly playing low from the dummy at trick one.South won the second trick with dummy's club ace, discarding a low diamond from his hand. He then cashed two top trumps in hand. Declarer continued with the diamond ace, a diamond to the king and a diamond ruff. When they split 3-3, South played a heart to dummy's jack and discarded a spade loser on the 13th diamond.After congratulating South on his play, West commented, \"Sorry, partner. Next time I'll lead fourth-highest from my longest and strongest.\" ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Best way to honor legacy of Anne Frank is simple\n\n March 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 725\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent chain of events led me to think about another chain of events during World War II for a young girl who once aspired to be a famous writer.She ultimately achieved that goal, but not in a way that she had ever dreamed about or ever aspired to do.\nHer name is Anne Frank.\nAnne died at age 15 along with most of her family in a Nazi concentration camp.\nBefore she and her family were sent to the concentration camp, they spent two years hiding from the Nazis in a secret sealed apartment in Amsterdam. During that time, Anne kept a written diary now known as \"The Diary of Anne Frank.\"\nHer diary was published posthumously in 1947. Translated into almost 70 languages, it is one of the most widely read accounts of the Holocaust.\nI had largely forgotten about Anne Frank and her diary until a series of unexpected events unfolded during a recent weekend.\nOn a Saturday afternoon, my wife and I drove to St. Michaels to enjoy a beautiful early spring day. It was a by all measures a perfect day.\nThe next morning was far from perfect.\nIt started when my wife launched a frantic search for her wallet. Like most wallets it contained her driver's license, credit cards and health insurance cards. It also included a substantial amount of cash for a Monday bank deposit to be used to pay for long-planned and much needed home improvement project.\nAfter retracing all her Saturday steps, we concluded her wallet likely fell out of her back pocket while we were sitting on a park bench in St. Michaels.\nI called the St. Michaels police to ask if anyone had turned in a lost wallet. The answer was no, not yet. The officer volunteered to go to the park and search for it. When he called back, he told us there was no trace of it. He also told us some who find lost wallets take the cash and throw the wallet into a trash can. He was kind enough to search the trash can in the park, but with no success.\nOnce we accepted that reality, I started to write a list of all the onerous tasks that follow the loss of a wallet.\nAngry and frustrated, I said to my wife, \"This is what the world has come to. No one cares anymore except about themselves. You lose a wallet, and no one turns it in. Worse yet, they probably took your cash and credit cards with no remorse telling themselves it was an unexpected stroke of 'good luck.'\"\nMinutes later, there was knock at our front door. A couple from Washington, D.C., whom we had never seen before told us they were also visiting St. Michaels on Saturday. They discovered her wallet. Using the address on my wife's driver's license they drove to our house on their return to Washington and delivered it.\nThey refused any reward other than accepting a heartfelt thank you.\nAs I reflected upon that unexpected random act of honesty and kindness my thoughts turned to Anne Frank and words she wrote in her diary.\nWith a wisdom and eloquence well beyond her years she penned, \"It's difficult in times like these: ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. It's a wonder I haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.\"\nWith all due respect to the memory of Anne, I cannot fully embrace her thinking that people are truly good at heart. Many are, but some are not and never will be. This was confirmed by her death, the deaths of most of her family (all but her father who saved her diary) and at least six million other innocent people who perished in concentration camps during the holocaust.\nThat said, our experience with a lost wallet was a reminder the best way to honor the legacy of Anne Frank is simple. Not always easy but a most meaningful way.\nIn difficult times like these when dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality, we can and we should strive very day to be people who are \"truly good at heart.\"\nDavid Reel is a public relations and public affairs consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You return home from the former bored but refreshed. From the latter, you are enlightened but exhausted. You feel as if you need a holiday to recover from your holiday.In bridge, there are declarers who play as if they have their heads buried in the sand, and those who are all eyes open and aware of the possibilities.\nTheir differing approaches are highlighted in today's deal.\nNorth's raise to three notrump was correct, especially as East's opening bid had marked where the opposing cards lay.\nThe head-in-the-sand South won the first trick with the heart ace and immediately took the diamond finesse.\nHowever, East won with the king and cleared the heart suit. Declarer, with only eight tricks (two spades, two hearts and four diamonds), had to attack clubs. But East won immediately with the ace and cashed three heart tricks to defeat the contract.\nThe eyes-open declarer, who realized that East rated to have the club ace and diamond king for his opening bid, saw the right line. He crossed to dummy's spade king at trick two. Then he led a low club toward his king. East had to duck his ace, else declarer would have nine tricks via two spades, two hearts, one diamond and four clubs. After winning with the club king, South took the diamond finesse, setting up nine tricks: two spades, two hearts, four diamonds and one club.\n©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, maybe you agree with Eugene Ionesco: \"We haven't the time to take our time.\"At the bridge table, though, we should take our time.When the dummy appears, all three active players should pause to plan the campaign.Sometimes we must judge the right time to win a particular trick.Today's deal was declared by Roger Trezel, a Frenchman who died in 1986. How did he time the play in five spades after West had led the diamond king? West's bidding isn't recommended. First, why preempt when you might be able to make three no-trump? A two-diamond overcall is normal. Second, having jumped to four diamonds, West shouldn't have bid five.If he was willing to go to five diamonds, he should have bid it on the first round.Despite West's sacrifice, Trezel wasn't willing to assume that East had the club ace. To try to establish the heart suit without risking East's gaining the lead, Trezel ducked the opening lead.When West continued with a diamond to dummy's ace, declarer discarded a low heart. South drew trumps, cashed the heart ace, played a heart to dummy's king and ruffed a heart. Back to dummy with a trump, Trezel discarded two club losers on dummy's heart winners.Nicely done.At another table, South won the first trick with dummy's diamond ace. However, after drawing trumps ending in the dummy, he called for the diamond two. When East failed to put in the 10, South discarded a low heart and recovered from his earlier error. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Carey Deeley, Jr. sentenced Todd Holtzman, 57, to 15 years in prison and suspended all but eight years of active incarceration after he pleaded guilty to robbery.The case against Holtzman stemmed from his role in robbery reported shortly after 12:30 p.m. on Monday, April 17.Police said a man, later identified as Holtzman, entered the Bank of America from its rear entrance on Goldsborough Street and confronted a teller, demanding bills in certain denominations.The teller told police that the man put a black grocery bag under the sneeze guard at the counter and asked for money without dye packs or alarms, according to charging documents. The teller also told police that the man said he would not hurt her.After the teller gave the man the money, the man exited the bank from the same entrance on Goldsborough Street.The total amount stolen was $3,210, police said in charging documents.Holtzman will have to pay Bank of America the full stolen amount as restitution.Video surveillance reviewed later showed Holtzman discarding the hoodie and sunglasses in the area of 25 N. Harrison Street, police said.A K-9 team from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office tracked him to the area of the Walmart on Elliott Road near the bus stop, but did not find him.A Delmarva Community Transit bus driver told police they recalled picking up the man from Walmart about 45 minutes after the robbery and dropping him off in Cambridge 30 minutes later.In the same hearing in Talbot County Circuit Court, Holtzman also pleaded guilty to fourth-degree burglary in connection to an incident at Walgreens about a week before the bank robbery. He received a three-year sentence, all of which was suspended, according to court filings.Following his release from prison, Holtzman will be placed on five years of supervised probation. He is barred from entering the Bank of America and Walgreens. \n \n Caption: FILE PHOTO\n \nA Talbot County Sheriff's Office vehicle is on the scene of a bank robbery in downtown Easton.\n \nFILE PHOTO\n \nThe downtown location of the Bank of America is situated on the corner of Washington Street and Goldsborough Street.\n \nFILE PHOTO\n \nThe rear door of the Bank of America opens on to Goldsborough Street. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Elmer Davis in Ward 4.ROBERT RANKIN\nRobert Rankin is a newcomer to Easton politics, yet he displayed a firm grasp of the issues facing the town.\nWe liked his stands on issues, and most importantly, we liked that he admitted when he needed more information before voicing a conclusive opinion on issues we asked about.\nRankin's professionalism was evident. He called for a multi-faceted approach to increasing affordable housing in Easton, stressing the need to get more housing that is affordable for young families. His suggestions included working with developers to provide incentives, looking for more projects with townhomes and apartments, and redeveloping existing properties. It was a thoughtful answer.\nRankin also talked about his concerns on how new residential developments impact traffic, parking, schools and public safety. He wants an emphasis on a more strategic approach to approving future projects.\nHe wants to see more pedestrian-friendly and traffic calming features throughout the town. One suggestion included more crosswalks and sidewalks to better support pedestrian safety.\nHe was the only candidate to talk about increasing recreational opportunities on the east side of Route 50 where the majority of Ward 2 is located.\nHe suggested looking at retirement packages to assist in recruiting and retaining police officers in Easton.\nOne last note: Rankin has managed trade associations during his career. He knows what it is like to build consensus among many competing interests. Those will be valuable skills on the council.\nTHE REV. ELMER DAVIS\nThe Rev. Elmer Davis has long been a voice for people in the 4th Ward. He is also a voice of reason in the city during council meetings. Davis is not afraid to speak his mind, but his background as a preacher and pastor helps him look for common ground.\nDavis noted his position on the Town Council dais. As the Ward 4 council member, he is the last one called to voice an opinion on discussion topics. This gives him a chance to hear all of the other council members. Often his message is one of finding consensus in disparate views.\n\"I aim to continue bridging the gap between the council and the people I represent, ensuring every voice is heard and valued,\" he said.\nDavis was prophetic when he asked the question in our interview: \"What do we want Easton to be?\"\nHis multi-part answer is a walkable community with sufficient traffic infrastructure to keep the town moving. He suggested a bus service from hotels to downtown to get visitors to the shops that make Easton special. He was solution oriented.\nDavis called for ensuring that first responders have the equipment and resources to respond to any incident.\nHe offered the best option we have heard for building affordable housing in the community — having the town purchase land and then partnering with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity to build the homes, involving the future homeowner in the process.\nHe said the town needs affordable housing \"that people working at WaWa and McDonald's can afford.\"\nHe wants the council involved in approving housing projects in Easton. The Planning Commission, he said, should be making recommendations, not granting approvals.\nOne of his two opponents, Moonyene Jackson-Amis, would be our pick if Davis had not been doing such a fine job during his five years on the council. She is a former council member, an attorney and a community leader with multiple college degrees. She spoke passionately in our conversations about underrepresented communities in Easton. She continues to be a foundational rock in our town.\nBut Davis is our pick to continue his work on the council. He has done well these past five years, and he has become the face of Ward 4 with deep connections throughout the community.\nDavis has experience, civility and strong ties to the community. He talks about his close-knit connection to his roots in the community shaping his values.\n\"I believe there is still much work to be done to enhance the quality of life for our residents,\" Davis said. We agree, and the reverend is the person to do that. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This popular dance is perhaps the best known example of klezmer music, a style of instrumental music that dates back centuries.\nAt 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 6, at Temple B'nal Israel, the Satell Center for Jewish Life on the Eastern Shore, The Seth Kibel Trio will entertain with a program of klezmer music (Eastern European Jewish folk music).\nThe trio will also take some musical detours into Yiddish theater, Yiddish folksong, as well as jazz and swing.\n\"Historical commentary and anecdotes from Kibel will provide an insightful context for their selections. A pre-concert lecture presentation from Kibel will make this a true evening of \"edutainment,\" according to an announcement from the Easton synagogue.\n\"This program is presented as part of the Susan and Barry Koh Music Series. Klezmer, which literally means 'tool of song' in Yiddish, is the secular folk music of Jews of Central and Eastern Europe. In the first decades of the 1900s, this music flourished not only in the Old World but also in the New, in the immigrant community of New York City,\" the announcement reads. \"The result was a quintessentially American sound.\"\n\"Seth Kibel is one of the Mid-Atlantic's premier woodwind specialists, working with klezmer, jazz, swing, and other bands. Wowing audiences on clarinet, flute, and saxophone, Seth has made a name for himself in the Washington/Baltimore region, and beyond. He is the featured performer with The Kleztet, Bay Jazz Project, Music Pilgrim Trio, The Natty Beaux, and more,\" according to the announcement. \"His most recent recording, \"Clown With A Stick,\" was released in May 2023 on the Azalea City Recordings record label. www.sethkibel.com.\"\nEveryone is welcome, admission is free.

    "content": "Why are decoys so expensive? Artists, collectors share the value of carvings, community\n\n November 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 653\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON – Decoys have long been used in hunting communities, but to the crowd at the Waterfowl Festival, the wood carvings serve more than just a utilitarian purpose.According to Cooper Rossner, a Talbot County decoy carver, the imitation birds and mammals can also be used as historic art pieces for nature lovers.\nAs a teenager in south New Jersey, Rossner was mesmerized by a carving demonstration in a natural sciences high school class. Rossner said right before his eyes, a carver turned a piece of wood into a Canada Goose.\nThis demonstration would be the first step into his lifelong passion for carving decoys. The carver at his school would soon become his mentor, and the following weekend he met an additional mentor during a Ducks Unlimited event.\n\"I was probably 15 years old, and here I am turning 30 in a week, and I'm still obsessed with it, still carving every chance I get,\" Rossner said. \"... carving is my world, and is my mind, and is my heart and soul. It puts everything that I love together: working with my hands, artwork, the history of it, the wildlife, the hunting aspect — it wraps it all up.\"\nThe hours of labor and craft artists like Rossner put into the carvings mean sometimes decoys come with a hefty price tag.\nJon Deeter, co-owner of Guyette and Deeter, a decoy auction firm, said his firm surpassed $200 million in total sales during 2020. In his experience, decoys at his firm would minimally be sold at $300. The most his firm had sold a single decoy for was $480,000.\nAccording to Deeter, pricing on decoys depends on a variety of factors. Vintage decoys made between 1850-1950 tend to be more valuable than contemporary decoys made after 1962. Additionally, the history and ownership of a decoy also impacts its value, similar to how provenance affects the value of fine art.\nRarity and originality also play a large role in the pricing of a decoy. The decoys made by renowned carvers like the Ward Brothers from Crisfield, Maryland can fetch prices in the six-figure range. Limited production, unique design or age can often command premium prices at auction, with the record being $1.144 million for a pair of decoys.\nDeeter emphasized that decoy collecting is an expensive hobby, but many collectors are not purchasing the high budget decoys and are there for the simple pleasure and admiration of skilly crafted decoys and the history behind them.\nTyler Bryan, an Eastern Shore collector and hunter, said he has around 75 decoys and enjoys the story and history associated with the decoys he purchases.\nBryan said he came to collecting naturally, influenced by his upbringing on the Eastern Shore and his fascination with nature. But one of the main reasons he continues to collect is the close community of decoy collectors.\n\"The decoy collecting community is really a fantastic group of people,\" Bryan said. \"It's tight-knit. Everyone knows each other. Most people know what everyone collects, and they're very helpful.\"\nBryan recommends decoy newcomers seek out a mentor because there are facets to collecting that will be much easier to someone if they have a trusted mentor to guide them along the way. According to Bryan, plenty of people within the decoy collecting community are happy to take on a mentee.\nRossner said decoy collecting often gets associated with much older people and can be seen as a \"dying craft,\" but in his eyes, it deserves more recognition for the layers of complexity it holds and the community that has welcomed him.\nRossner said he encourages anyone interested to spend time with other carvers and collectors and learn more about the shared love this community has for decoys.\n\"There's lots of people still doing it, but not as many as there once were,\" Rossner said. \"So you are living history when you're carving a decoy or you're doing an art form … you're doing something that's been handed down generation by generation.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This colleague has known my daughter since she was a young child, so I feel extremely uncomfortable about this situation - and a little angry. My daughter is in her late 20s now, so the decision is ultimately up to her, but even if they were to hit it off, I know I'd never be OK with it. - Stay AwayDEAR STAY AWAY: Step back a moment and think about your colleague.What redeeming qualities does this man have as a person? What do you know about his relationship history? Has he ever done anything untoward regarding your daughter?Assess as much as you can about him and his character. It is understandably unnerving for this to be happening, but you are not in control of this.DEAR HARRIETTE: I have been a board member of my church for a long time, and it's a big part of my life. I am in a relatively new relationship with someone who is not interested in discussing church or religion and refuses to attend church-related events. This makes it hard for me to balance my personal life and my involvement in the church. It's important to me that they at least try to come to an event with me every once in a while. - Trying To CompromiseDEAR TRYING TO COMPROMISE: I understand why you want to make space for this person, but it doesn't sound like they are reciprocating. If your church life is that important to you, how are you going to make this work? It seems unreasonable for them to be completely uninvolved.Harriette Cole is a lifestylist and founder of DreamLeapers, an initiative to help people access and activate their dreams.

It will serve Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot counties.\nThe timing couldn't be better. Construction has finally begun next to the Talbot Community Center on a long-promised, modern inpatient medical facility — expected to open in 2028. Yet even the most advanced hospital is useless without skilled, dedicated staff.\nOur current Memorial Hospital depends heavily on traveling doctors and nurses. While competent and committed, they aren't rooted in our community. Many of us remember a time when our health care providers lived next door, when nurses were trained locally at the McQueen-Gibbs School, and when the hospital was the region's largest employer. The quality of care felt stronger because the staff had a personal stake in our well-being.\nMemorial Hospital once helped drive local economic growth. Quality health care made Talbot County attractive to retirees, professionals, and families alike — people drawn to both the lifestyle and the peace of mind that came with reliable, community-centered care.\nThe ITCH program aims to reignite that connection by:\nIntroducing health care careers early.Supporting local students through their journey.Building a skilled, homegrown workforce.Reconnecting the hospital and the community.\nThese are long-term goals, but the potential return on investment is huge — economically and socially.\nI urge my neighbors to support ITCH in any way they can. Whether through mentorship, donations or spreading the word, every effort matters. Let's bring the hospital back to the community — and the community back to the hospital.\nThanks to the Star-Democrat for shining a light on this promising initiative.\nHUGH M.

MICHAELS — A dog park in St. Michaels has been in discussion for almost four years. Now, with a special meeting planned, the town and commissioners are turning their attention to finding a location where the dog park can properly serve the community.The commissioners want to take into account multiple factors when decided the location of the dog park, including cost of building and maintenance, liability concerns, who is allowed to use the park, and limiting the amount of people affected by the noise and traffic.\nWhile a date is still being chosen for the special meeting, some dog owners in town said they were excited that the town is looking to get the ball rolling.\n\"It's exciting,\" said Jonathan Dietrich, St. Michaels resident and owner of two dogs, as he was walking his dogs through town. \"It's exciting as long as the location is right and everybody approves of it. I know it's been a very long journey, and it's pretty complicated, but it would be great. It would be great if we could get one but we'll see what happens.\"\nWhen dog park discussion started in St. Michaels four years ago, a group of lawyers in St. Michaels came together and created a group called \"The Friends of St. Michaels Dog Park.\"\nMember Devon Hewitt spoke at the August town meeting about donors for the dog park and potential locations.\nAccording to Hewitt the group of lawyers did research and came up with multiple locations, but the conversations fell through. After the new commissioners were elected, conversations began again.\nWhile determining the master plan for San Domingo Creek Park construction at the August Town Council meeting, discussion arose about a dog park being included in the master plan. The town commissioners decided not to include a dog park in the plan.\nOne of the reasons brought forward at the meeting was that if dog park plans were added to the master plan, the grant received from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources could be pulled back.\nWhile the location for the potential dog park is unclear, St. Michaels residents say they are ready to see movement.\nWhen Stacy Sass, a resident of St. Michaels, was asked how soon she would hope to see a dog park in St. Michaels for her dog Ginger to play in, she said, \"tomorrow.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It featured a textbook example for maintaining trump control.How should South play in four hearts after West leads the club king?Yes, I was the only North to rebid two hearts rather than one spade. However, I still like my call despite the poor trumps. It backfires when partner is 4-4 or 4-5 in the majors and not strong enough to bid again.Otherwise, she will rebid two spades, and I will raise. I win when she has five hearts and a weak hand. This way, we find our eight-card fit.Also, if she were to rebid two clubs over one spade, I would have to pass. Two hearts would promise some 16 high-card points. Note also that my wife's jump to four hearts promised at least five trumps. With only four, she would have rebid three notrump or fudged somehow!Finally, yes, she might have rebid three diamonds or four clubs (a splinter bid). I would have signed off with such useless trumps.The danger to four hearts is a bad trump break, which is almost a certainty at BBO!The correct technique is to win the first trick and to duck a round of trumps. You ruff West's club continuation and now cash the heart ace to see the expected 4-1 division. However, you play on diamonds to set up your side suit and cruise home, losing only three trump tricks.Starting with the heart ace and another heart is fatal here. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Hollywood producer returning to Talbot roots for fresh perspective\n\n November 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 377\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Chris Moore has many titles to his name: Harvard University Graduate, director, producer of \"American Pie\" and \"Good Will Hunting,\" and one of his favorites: Talbot County native.Moore, after making his name in Hollywood, is coming back to the Eastern Shore to hear from the locals who helped him fall in love with film.\nAt the Oxford Community Center Thursday, Nov. 21, he will seek to engage in valuable dialogue with residents to better understand what movie lovers from across the country are wanting to see from the film industry.\n\"I could have been originally from somewhere else where, honestly, I wouldn't care what they had to say, but the thing about Talbot County, and what I love about coming back to it… is that it's a real slice of America,\" Moore said.\nMoore said he grew up going to the Avalon and loving the world that TV and movies took him to.\nAfter studying American history at Harvard, where he met and worked with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, he left for California, where he worked in the mailroom at an agency and later got promoted to literary agent before selling several scripts, including \"The Stoned Age,\" \"PCU,\" \"Airheads\" and \"My Girl.\"\nHe later went on to produce 1999 film classic \"American Pie,\" a breakout hit that launched Moore's career as a Hollywood producer.\nBut for Moore, a lot has changed since the 1990s, including the way that people watch films. Subscription-based streaming services have changed audiences' consumption of content by \"over producing\" content and making it difficult to gauge what people actually want to see, he said.\nMoore said he wants to take a step back and go back to his roots to better understand how to give audiences quality content. And for him there's no better sounding board than the people of the Eastern Shore.\nFor Moore, the event on Thursday will be interactive, funny and most importantly informative of what he believes best represents American culture and audiences.\n\"I don't want people to think this is like going to a college lecture,\" Moore said. \"We're going to have some fun and talk about movies and talk about entertainment, talk about fun stuff and in a way that people laugh and can engage and it can be a lively night.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Events include the Festival of Trees, which is held in the Tidewater Inn, as well as Carols by Candlelight, Santa's Workshop, Santa 5K Fun Run/Walk and a jewelry raffle.Every year, there is a theme for the festival, which is put on by the Friends of Talbot Hospice. This year's theme is \"Holiday Traditions.\" The trees will be decorated based on that theme, festival chairman Karla Wieland-Cherry said.\n\"It takes a year to plan. It's a lot of work,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"It's all volunteer work, all volunteers. And this is our 39th year. The big thing is the trees, so we have the trees sponsored by various businesses, organizations and individuals. And they can either choose to decorate the tree, or we also have a list of volunteers who will come in and decorate the tree.\"\nThe festival raises funds for Talbot Hospice. Wieland-Cherry emphasized the work of volunteers in raising hospice funds, as well as the family aspect of the weekend-long event.\n\"My children are involved, my son comes and volunteers, my daughter used to sing, my husband, he's the music chairman,\" Wieland-Cherry said.\n\" ... It's just a wonderful way to kick off the holiday season,\" she continued. \"I have such a blessed team of volunteers that work so hard to make this such a success.\"\nOn Friday night, the Preview Gala will kick off the festivities. From 6 to 8 p.m., guests will have the first opportunity to view 100 exquisitely trimmed trees of varying sizes. Tickets to the gala are available in advance for $125 per person or $200 per couple.\nWhile the larger trees are sponsored in advance, gala guests get the first opportunity to purchase the smaller trees, from 12 inches to three feet and in varying price ranges.\nThe Gold Ballroom at the Tidewater Inn opens to the public Saturday morning and remains open through Tuesday. As always, local performers will be cycling throughout the event to provide music and singing.\nAlso Saturday morning, participants will hit the pavement at 9 a.m. for the Santa 5K Fun Run/Walk. There will be on-site registration starting at 8 a.m. at Idlewild Park in Easton and advance sign-ups will be available online.\nLater in the day, Santa's Workshop opens. From 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on both Saturday and Sunday in the Tidewater Inn's Ballroom Garden, children will rotate through stations after being greeted by Santa and posing for photographs.\nChildren can write letters to Santa, participate at craft stations, play games and enjoy a selfie station with props for photo opportunities. Santa's Workshop is no additional charge to those that pay for admission to the Festival of Trees.\nReturning for the fifth year, Carols by Candlelight is an event free for all families. On Saturday from 5 to 7 p.m. Families can sing along with choral groups, bell ringers and musicians while enjoying hot cocoa and holiday treats.\nSanta will be located on the grounds of The Bullitt House at the corner of Washington Street and Dover Street in downtown Easton. Other visitors include The Grinch, Elsa and Buddy the Elf.\nThis year, the Festival of Trees introduces a Fine Jewelry Raffle, courtesy of Kyle Edward Fine Jewelry of Easton. A pair of satin ball earrings and a diamond bezel necklace will be offered in the raffle to benefit Talbot Hospice. One raffle ticket costs $25 and is available online at and at Kyle Edward Fine Jewelry on 27 South Harrison St. The raffle will be drawn at 5:30 p.m. on Dec. 3 at the conclusion of Festival of Trees.\nNew this year is the debut of one-of-a-kind, keepsake luminaries in honor of a loved one. Designed and created by Pat and Eric Harvey, a limited number of the metal luminaries will be sold online, then displayed in the Gold Ballroom. At the conclusion of the Festival of Trees, the luminaries will be available for pickup in time to enjoy for the holiday season.\nAs Christmas is a season for remembering, friends and family remember their loved ones in a very special way by purchasing a poinsettia. The name of someone dear is placed on a Memory Scroll next to a stunning 12-foot poinsettia \"tree\" in the Tidewater Inn's Gold Ballroom.\nFriends of Hospice was formed in 1984 and began hosting the Festival of Trees in 1986 to raise money for the Talbot Hospice Foundation. To date, close to $4 million has been raised by the Festival of Trees to assist with Talbot Hospice's operating budget.\nAs a celebration of life for those who have received Hospice care during the past year, the continued success of Festival of Trees is made possible by the generous financial contributions from local individuals and various businesses. To get involved in any capacity, or to inquire about a sponsorship, contact Festival of Trees Co-Chairmen Karla Wieland-Cherry at dkcherry4@aol.com or 410-310-8421 and Denise Haddaway at 443-995-4431 or denise.haddaway@gmail.com.\nTo learn more about Talbot Hospice, visit talbothospice.org.

    "content": "King's granddaughter carrying forward his legacy\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JESSICA A. JOHNSON | Section: Columns \n \n 673\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I happened to catch the recent \"CBS Mornings\" news interview of Yolanda Renee King, the only grandchild of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King. While promoting her new children's book honoring her grandparents titled \"We Dream a World,\" Yolanda gave a profound answer when asked what she would say to them if they were alive today. \"I think I would first start off with an apology,\" she said, which was surprising to CBS host Nate Burleson, who immediately asked the young activist what she meant by her response. Yolanda continued, \"An apology to where we are right now, as a nation and really as a world.\"Yolanda is only 15 years old, and it is evident that she has a deep understanding of what her grandparents fought for as leaders of the civil rights movement. In August of last year, during the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Yolanda boldly declared that her generation would \"be defined by action, not apathy.\"\nAs Yolanda is growing up before our eyes, she has the youthful exuberance of her grandfather's resolve and displays the dignified grace of her grandmother. Yolanda saying she would apologize to her grandparents for our nation not yet reaching the potential they believed in should make us thoughtfully reflect on how Dr. King also warned about becoming apathetic.\nApathy is a brutal paralyzer of life. It can cause us to be ensnared in a dangerous mode of stagnation emotionally, spiritually, and sometimes physically. Apathy also triggers entitled disinterest in our society. In 2021, Tom Nichols, an instructor at Harvard Extension School and the U.S. Naval War College, asserted in an interview with The Harvard Gazette that \"narcissism and nihilism\" are the primary threats to our country's democracy and societal relationships. Elaborating on the latter, Nichols said that many people ask why our society is \"so mean and heartless and awful,\" but many of them do not contribute anything to make their communities better, or they will vote against policies that affect their well-being due to \"narcissistic beefs.\"\n\"We have become surly villagers,\" Nichols maintained, \"me, my family, my little plot of land, and everybody else can go to hell.\" This type of sullen attitude is what Yolanda is urging our country to overcome as she is an emerging voice on critical issues such as gun violence and homelessness.\nAs Yolanda continues to attentively study the Godly principles that enabled her grandfather to be that drum major for justice who changed the course of our nation, I am reminded of two of his sermons where he encouraged his followers to live with purpose and passion and to shower others with Christian love.\nThe first sermon is titled \"But If Not,\" a 1967 message that King delivered at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church. King expresses that the \"ultimate test\" of our faith is when we get to a \"but if not\" moment in life, a moment where we have to travel along an arduous journey with no other option but to lean on God's promises.\nThis passage stands out to avoid being gripped by apathy during a spiritual test: \"... somewhere along the way [in life] you should discover something that's so dear, so precious to you, that is so eternally worthful, that you will never give it up.\" The second sermon is \"Levels of Love,\" an Ebenezer address King gave in 1962. He implored the congregation to \"rise to agape, to Christian love\" because \"[t]he greatness of it is that you love every man, not for your sake but for his sake. And you love every man because God loves him.\"\nIt is remarkable that Yolanda exemplifies the love and compassion her grandparents demonstrated as she diligently works to uplift others. She is blazing her own path, and it is truly inspiring to watch it unfold.

    "content": "Academy Art Museum gets new director\n\n November 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: Arts \n \n 511\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Charlotte Potter Kasic, the new director of the Academy Art Museum, has a lot of ideas. But her first weeks, she said, will be dedicated to completing a listening tour.Her latest post was the Barry Art Museum in Norfolk, Virginia, where she was executive director. Now she has a new challenge with helming the Academy.\n\"Every time I see a challenge, I lean in,\" Kasic said.\nShe was not entirely unfamiliar with the Academy Art Museum before applying for the job.\n\"When Eric Neil left the Academy in 2012 or 2013, he became the director of the Chrysler Museum of Art, and I was the director of the Chrysler Museum Glass Studio, which was like an annex,\" Kasic said.\nShe's been impressed with the museum's existing work and potential.\n\"When you break it down, there are classes. There are programs and exhibitions. There is collections. There is fundraising. There are galas. It is wild how much happens here with so little. I think this place is doing a great job of hitting a lot of audiences,\" she said.\nKasic is excited to work with the staff to continue these efforts.\nKasic has past in glass blowing, in which she said she learned about collaboration and teamwork. She created Cirque de Verre (circus of glass), which traveled around the United States to museums and art spaces that had glass blowing furnaces.\n\"Glass I love because you work in teams. It is hot. It is visceral. There is a lot of strong communication skills,\" Kasic said. \"I like things to be immersive, multisensory and interdisciplinary. When you think of olfactory, that is how you access your deepest memories. Music can change your mood in a minute. Art can do that as well.\"\nKasic has a masters degree from Rhode Island School of Design and has done residencies at Penland, Oxbow, Pilchuck and in Australia.\nAfter the Chrysler she moved to Vermont to start a family. She ended up being the director at the Yestermorrow Design Build School, which celebrates sustainable design and craft.\nThe siren song of Norfolk brought her and her family back to the Chesapeake, where she joined the team at the Barry Museum. She says it has become the glass art capital of the East Coast. There, Kasic helmed a 25,000 square foot expansion and closed out a $23 million campaign.\nNow at the Academy Art Museum, she sees a collaborative community that brings Plein Air, The Craft Show and the Waterfowl Festival into the institution. She also has a clear-eyed approach to what the Academy can offer the community.\n\"I would like to see more of our permanent collection on view. We have so much that exists but people don't get to see,\" she said.\nEven with these plans, she realizes that there is a lot of collaborating to be done.\n\"It is important to say how invested the board is in this place. I have seen more board involvement and more community investment than any other organization I have been in. People are so dedicated. It is really remarkable and it speaks to the strength of this place,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This is Walls' third World Goose Calling Championship win.\nAfter yelling for joy with his fists in the air, Walls told emcee Dave Bloodsworth, \"It's the Super Bowl, man.\" He thanked his friends and family before talking about celebration plans.\n\"I'm going to have a lot of fun tonight,\" he said. \"It's a bad night to be a Busch Light.\"\nOther champions of the night include Logan Heibner, 16, named Jr. World Live Duck Calling champion; JT Johnson, 15, named Jr. World Goose Calling champion; Chandler Martin and Slayton Gearin, named World Team Live Duck Calling champions; brothers Bryan and Bobby Heim, named World Team Live Goose Calling champions; Seth Fields, named World Live Duck Calling champion and Chance Wadsworth, named World Live Goose Calling champion.\nAfter his win, Fields thanked his wife.\n\"For listening to all my routines in the kitchen,\" he said.\nBloodsworth said five judges in the back of the auditorium graded contestants on their routine, flow and sound throughout the night.\nBefore the competition began, junior callers Carter Whaley, 14, and Peter Aul, 16, sat on the stage, feeling both nervous and excited for the final competitions of the night to begin.\nFor Aul, who traveled from Pennsylvania for the championships, it was his first time at the Waterfowl Festival. He said he found out about the festival through buddies.\nAs for how he got into calling: \"I just got a call and started running it better than everybody in my area and decided, you know what? I'm going to throw my name in.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Participation is free, with pre-registration needed at christmasinstmichaels.org/events.\nThe 2024 Christmas in St. Michaels Collectors Ornament has also been announced and is the 21st in the series. This year's ornament depicts the Chesapeake deadrise workboat with its crew and a friendly canine companion. The image was provided by St. Michaels artist Sherry Smith.\nThe boxed ornament is available for purchase at select local retail shops and the weekend-long Christmas in St. Michaels Marketplace and Sweet Shoppe. Online purchases can be made at www.christmasinstmichaels.org/ornament.\nThe deadrise workboat has been a staple among Chesapeake watermen for decades. \"Deadrise\" refers to the almost flat, V-shaped hull that provides a shallow draft to accommodate the waters in creeks and rivers of the Eastern Shore. Boats range from 25-45 feet in length and are powered by large, inboard four- or six-cylinder engines, usually diesel-fueled.\nWorkboats typically sport women's names on the transom or bow, paying tribute to wives and daughters. Others, such as the one in this ornament, refer to the town, river or creek the boat calls home port.\n\"It is typical to see dozens of these deadrise workboats plying the waters of the Eastern Shore in the wee hours of the morning as they seek the day's catch, returning to the pier in the early afternoon to get their catch to market,\" says Christmas in St. Michaels Chair Pat Martin. \"We're honored to add this limited-edition ornament to our collection to pay tribute to watermen and their boats in the St. Michaels area and the Chesapeake Bay region at large.\"\nEvent details, online ticket and ornament purchases, and more about Christmas in St. Michaels are at christmasinstmichaels.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We have cities that have been ruled by Democrats for decades and they are the worst in the nation and if you don't think so just look at Baltimore, Chicago, L.A. and New York to name a few.How long will people be tied to one party that they would rather see our nation go down the tube then to do what is right for our children and grandchildren.If we continue in the direction that we are going, undermining our Constitution and Bill of Rights, we will be a dictatorship with one ruling party taking away our guns, closing our places of worship, giving us run away inflation and forcing us to buy total electric.

One by one, students were moved throughout the kitchen and shown the behind-the-scenes of sweet treats and rich desserts.\nJulia Foxwell, director of community engagement for Bluepoint Hospitality, said it was a delight for the chefs to share their passion for sweets with the students.\n\"We have been working with the Chesapeake Multicultural Center for some time on how best to support their initiatives while also providing enriching experiences to their students,\" Foxwell said. \"Bringing the girls and boys in to learn kitchen basics — from prep to final product — exposes them to new concepts, flavors and perhaps a future passion of their own. Chefs (Harley) Peet and Heim loved hosting the kids in the kitchen and even got a few ideas for new flavors.\"\nVictoria Gomez Lozano, Hispanic outreach coordinator for Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said this program is important in reaching out to community members who may not know about the center's services.\n\"We started this program to give the underserved children of this community the opportunity to have extracurricular activities and to be exposed to a lot of things that they may not have the opportunity to,\" Gomez Lozano said. \"It's also a good way to contact their parents and the families in the community as well so they can open up to us and so we can give them our services.\"\nAt the end of the tour, every student was given a scoop of ice cream and a choice of toppings to create their own flavor.\nEach student enjoyed the ice cream while laughing with friends.\nStudent Yerelin Fuentes said she has been in the after-school program for a few years now and loves the chance to learn new things and spend time with her friends outside of class. But what she loves most, she said, is the ability to learn to be a good person.\n\"They show us how to be a hero,\" Fuentes said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Howard Anthony Community Service Award.For All Seasons is a behavioral health and rape crisis center. They are also the only agency in Talbot County doing this work in Spanish and English.\nThey bring in 20 to 25 new people a week for their new no wait five-days-a-week services. Because of COVID-19 they got skillful at telehealth and now offer services in all 24 jurisdictions in Maryland.\nAccording to Beth Spurry, the president and owner of Wye Finanicial Trust and a mentor of Dorman's, in the past decade, Dorman has taken the organization from just 24 employees to over 100, most of whom are women.\n\"Because those nearly 100 employees that are meeting the mental health, the rape crisis needs of our community are the employees that are handling the toughest of the tough and doing it with a smile on their face. I have a smile on my face because of them. So thank you for this award,\" Dorman said.\nA few days after the award was announced, she reflected.\n\"It is their largest award. I was first a part of Rotary when I first got out of college. It was called a group study exchange,\" Dorman said. \"The group study is a professional exchange. I was given the opportunity to apply to be a part of a group that traveled to Japan. I was there for six weeks. I visited higher ed places in the Ibaraki Prefecture.\"\nIt is a specialized award. You cannot have been in Rotary for 10 years. You have to have lived and worked in the community in which you were serving for 10 years.\n\"It is a big deal for them. They have an opportunity to pick one person from the community. So I was blown away when he (Tom Hill) called me and told me that it was going to be me,\" Dorman said.\n\"I think it brings to light the importance of living through service in your community. That is the core of who I am, as far as servant leadership. I am as good as the team I have put together. We continue to serve in the community. It spurs a conversation about the importance of service no matter how big or small,\" Dorman said.\nFor All Seasons hosts many events throughout the year, like the backpack giveaway and Frosty's Holiday Village, that reach thousands of people.\n\"In all of that, the biggest piece for me is providing an example for my children, for women, for girls, for young people. My kids know I am busy and on my phone all the time, but they always know I am doing really important work. And that plants in them that they can be someone in the community,\" Dorman said.\nShe said she has a supportive team that helps her. Starting with her husband and her kids, Dave and Melinda Finley at Anchor Church on Goldsboro, Alice Ryan of the Women and Girls Fund, and Spurry.\n\"I was given a huge gift at the awards ceremony in having her (Spurry) be the person to present me the award. Beth has not only been a guiding light, but a pretty strong mentor. She will say, 'I think you can do better and here is why.' She has been an incredibly encouraging mentor,\" Dorman said.\nShe said this was a really important moment in her career.\n\"If all fell away tomorrow, this is the community that has supported me as I am supporting them. I will have a part of the Anthony family legacy forever and be able to say here is the impact I had in the community, which I call home,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Playing for money, North would have doubled five hearts and collected 300 points.However, worried that most pairs would buy it in four spades, North pushed on to five spades.Clearly, South had to avoid a club loser, and he knew to leave the key suit as late as possible. He ruffed the second heart, drew one round of trumps and played a diamond to the king. East took that trick and played another trump. Declarer won on the board, cashed the diamond jack, crossed to the spade queen and played off the diamond queen and 10, pitching clubs from the dummy.It was time to work out the club position. What had South learned?East was known to have started with three spades and five diamonds. The bidding also strongly suggested that East had four hearts. If so, his hand distribution was 3=4=5=1.Singularity rules. Declarer cashed his club king and ran the club jack, chosen to encourage an unwise cover.Well counted. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The event raises money for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Their motto is \"We ride for those who died.\"\nAnyone on any level of law enforcement can make the ride. Although Denton is a nice spot in the middle of their ride, there were no law enforcement officers from Caroline County in the ride.\n\"The Denton Fire Chief and Town Manager have all been great to us, opening doors. The vo-tech kids cooked lunch for us. The Culinary Center fed us,\" said Marlboro, New Jersey, Police Department Lt. Nicholas Szymanski.\n\"In 16 years, we have ridden through Denton every year. We had 650 on bicycles and another 150 or so on support. We started in Lewes, Delaware, and stopped just short of the bridge in Kent Island,\" Szymanski said.\nThese men and women have lots of visible support, not just from massive American flags hoisted between two fire truck ladders, but mini flag waving children who offer high fives along the way.\n\"We have chapter trucks and trailers that bring Gatorade, waters, snacks. We have a full mechanic's truck, ambulances and motor units. Believe it or not, we had the commissioner of Highway Patrol in California ride with us this year. We had about 50 motorcycles in our group alone. They will stop intersections for us. Once we start pedaling we don't stop,\" Szymanski said.\nTheir efforts have raised a lot of money over the years.\n\"Our chapter had 440 riders, and we raised over $400,000. We raised over $2 million overall. It is for fallen police officers. Our responsibility it to make sure that the names of the former police officers aren't forgotten,\" Szymanski said.\nAll the money goes to the National Law Enforcement Museum and the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n\"All the names of the fallen officers are enshrined on (the memorial). There are 25,000 names on there at least. We did an expansion last year for more stones to have room for more names. We add five or 10 names to that wall every year,\" Szymanski said.\nThe names are important. But supporting the families who have lost loved ones is essential, he said.\n\"The most important of it — the reason we do this is we bring survivors along with us. That is somebody's family member that was killed in the line of duty. We have their wives, their kids, their family members, fathers, mothers ride with us. We had 50 survivors ride with us this year,\" he said.\nWhat started with 18 riders in 1997 has grown exponentially.

    "content": "Ward 4 candidates talk property taxes, housing\n\n April 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 734\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Candidates for the Ward 4 seat on the Easton Town Council have offered varying opinions on the town's property tax rate.Incumbent the Rev. Elmer Davis, Moonyene Jackson-Amis and Cameron Keefe are squaring off in the town's election May 6. Each discussed their views on property taxes, housing and more in interviews with The Star Democrat's editorial board last week.\nCurrently, the town levies a tax on real property at 52 cents per $100 of assessed value. That mark hasn't changed since 2008. It's higher than Talbot County's other towns, but relatively low compared to Eastern Shore towns such as Cambridge, Denton and Salisbury.\nProperty values, though, have increased significantly in recent years. The state's 2025 reassessments showed the value of Group 1 residential and commercial properties in Talbot County increased by 22.1% from 2022. The town's proposed fiscal year 2026 budget projects $13.6 million in real property tax revenue, slightly up from last year. It was a tight and \"lean\" budget, Mayor Megan Cook has said.\nDavis, who's been on the council since 2020, said the property tax rate should be increased.\n\"I think the mayor's playing around a little bit. … They're not fiscally responsible,\" Davis said. \"We have not raised taxes, and here's the problem. We got that COVID money. We've been living high on the hog, and now we have to pay the piper.\"\nJackson-Amis, Ward 4's representative from 2001 to 2008, says the Town Council should have conversations with professionals about potential tax breaks.\n\"I think the property tax is a little steep,\" Jackson-Amis said. \"It seems like the idea is to get, to have a money funnel. A funnel as opposed to exacting what's necessary to support the budget.\"\nKeefe in his interview emphasized fiscal responsibility, while adding he understands new initiatives cost money.\n\"They make a lot of decisions that don't affect their wealth, but it affects everybody else's wealth,\" Keefe said of the council. \" ... We need to dismantle this ivory tower thing.\"\nHOUSING\nThe Ward 4 hopefuls each touched on plans to improve Easton's affordable housing stock. Keefe said \"we need to make Easton not just survivable, but livable.\"\n\"We can say all the buzz words we want, but I would love to see specifically starter homes in Easton, things that draw young families here,\" Keefe said.\nHe said he hopes to sit down with town planners to discuss their proposed inclusionary zoning ordinance that would require residential developers to allocate 15% of their units as affordable.\nJackson-Amis says she's \"all for inclusionary zoning.\" She hopes to revisit the requirement that developers include 25% low or middle-income units in projects, an effort she supported in her prior stint on the council.\n\"If you're getting a benefit from the town, we need to be able to exact a benefit from you,\" Jackson-Amis said. \"If you're creating housing, we ought to know what our housing needs are, and that it shouldn't just be for the financial gain of wealthy people.\"\nDavis said he's \"not 100% sure\" current housing legislation in the works will answer all of Easton's housing needs. He advocated for the town to buy a piece of land and work with nonprofits.\n\"The town should buy a piece of land,\" Davis said. \"And the town should partner with Habitat (for Humanity) or some other organization to … ensure that we deal holistically with the person and the property.\"\nEXPERIENCE\nThe Ward 4 candidates bring different experience levels to the table.\nDavis, 58, said he focused on constituent representation during his time on the council, such as when he supported a seafood odor ordinance last year.\n\"I'm in the position as the council member because of the people,\" he said. \"I represent those individuals in my ward. I'm not the end-all, be-all. So if my constituents say that this is what they want, then I represent them well.\"\nJackson-Amis, 77, said \"we should look toward wisdom.\"\n\"Right now you need people with some seasoned ability to ferret out issues and help bring solutions to problems,\" she said. \"So I don't think age really should be that important, but I think the experience is what should matter.\"\nKeefe, 25, said he wants more youth involvement in the town.\n\"I know I'm young. That is by no means any reason to take this lightly,\" Keefe said. \"I think this is important. I think there's a lot of potential for good that can happen from this. And above all of those things, I want to be a representative who listens.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It will impact town spending, how development takes place and whether we can work together to plan and achieve shared goals.\nWhile I don't doubt all the candidates are devoted to their families, kind to their neighbors, happy to live in Easton, and aware of the issues, we should all expect a great deal more from public servants.\nOnly one candidate, Moonyene Jackson-Amis — running to represent Ward 4 on the council — was truly impressive to me. This highly educated woman — a practicing attorney, compassionate activist and experienced local public servant — spoke in specifics, rather than generalities. It was clear that she understands the needs of the residents of Ward 4 and the town at large.\nShe talked about practical ways to help wage-earners qualify for licensing in their various trades by incentivizing contractors to take advantage of their skills, thereby facilitating their advancement. She called for a study on repurposing the current hospital as a regional medical center for military veterans. She advocated for updates to a program she initiated during her prior term on the council so that residents can afford to stay in their homes. She suggested a new tourist attraction that would make use of an unused existing building. And she had other practical ideas as well. It's clear she has a well-thought-out action plan ready to go if she's elected.\nWhat's more, Moonyene obviously knows how to leverage all the elements needed to bring plans to fruition. That is the essential asset drawn from her knowledge of the law and wealth of experience, an asset that others appear to lack. She wants to serve constituents, not herself.\nI believe our Town Council will be a stronger, more effective body if Moonyene is elected. I hope everyone in Ward 4 already has a plan to be at our fire station on May 6 to vote for Ms. Jackson-Amis.\nWENDY ROTH\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In some ways, that fiscal pressure has increased since.Michael Sanderson, the executive director of the Maryland Association of Counties, briefed the Talbot County Council on those financial troubles and more during a special meeting Tuesday.\nHe told council members a budget shortfall of potentially $600 to $800 million could be facing lawmakers in Annapolis. Fixing that is \"not easy, but not impossible,\" he said.\n\"There are a couple of years of that in our forecast, and then it gets really serious,\" Sanderson said.\nWhen fiscal year 2028 arrives, Sanderson warned that the state will run out of money in its trust fund that's been used for The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's expansive and optimistic education initiative.\nMany counties have been under significant financial pressure due to state requirements stemming from Blueprint. Sanderson says the state will be feeling that level of pressure soon.\n\"The counties are feeling it now,\" he said. \"The state doesn't really feel it for a couple years down the road, and that has been a meaningful disconnect.\"\nWithout significant timeline adjustments for Blueprint from the state, MACo feels there will continue to be that disconnect between the fiscal situation of the state versus the situation counties are facing. State funding for transportation, though, is already causing serious impacts, Sanderson said.\n\"The canary in the coal mine that's already chirping is in transportation,\" he told the council members. \" … The conversation in the summer time is sometimes ambiguous and hazy and that sort of thing. But this year, not so much. They were just saying, 'If there aren't already shovels in the ground, we can't afford the next thing.'\"\nThe Maryland Department of Transportation has been forced to delay many statewide projects amid a significant budget deficit. Earlier this month, the department released a draft plan that showed $1.3 billion in cuts from the state's six-year transportation plan.\nSanderson noted the \"state's transportation challenge is not a function of the Key Bridge\" rebuild, which is set to begin next year.\nAt the county level, council Vice President Pete Lesher said Talbot County is \"finding itself in a slightly different place\" than others.\n\"We are going through a number of capital construction projects, our health department, our sheriff's office, our 911 center,\" Lesher said, emphasizing some of those projects are receiving \"pandemic-era related funds\" from the federal government.\n\"The pinch that a lot of counties are feeling right now, the income tax, is not yet being felt in Talbot County,\" Lesher said. \"We can look around at our neighbors and see what is coming, even though we are not yet in that position now.\"\nLesher thanked Sanderson and MACo President Johnny Olszewski Jr. for their work to represent the counties at the state level year-round.\n\"We know that we are stronger together in Annapolis,\" Lesher said. \"And we see every year what a powerful voice MACo is for all of us jointly.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Family holding out hope for turf field project at Easton High\n\n August 22, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 695\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The prospects of an artificial turf field at Easton High School are uncertain as the school year approaches.Jen Hawley's 18-year-old daughter, Elgin, has been a champion of the turf field. Elgin asked for it to be added to the school district's budget request last year as part of her wish with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\nJen Hawley hoped to see the project take shape before Elgin left for college this summer. She asked Make-A-Wish to maintain its commitment to the project until July 31 before the nonprofit needed to begin working on a new wish for Elgin.\nTalbot County Public Schools received $1.5 million from the county meant to allocate towards outstanding capital projects this fiscal year, such as the turf field, which has an estimated price of $1.8 million.\nAt the end of July, Hawley said she was told the Board of Education is passing on partnering with Make-A-Wish for the turf field project.\n\"We're right back to where we started,\" Hawley said.\nIn mid-August of 2021, on the third day of field hockey tryouts, Elgin had an aneurysm on the field. It took almost two weeks after she collapsed before she began talking again, and it wasn't until February 2022 that she returned to school.\nElgin, who graduated this spring, hasn't been able to play field hockey since the aneurysm. When Make-A-Wish Mid-Atlantic granted her one wish, she asked for a turf field to be put in at Easton High.\nWith support from Make-A-Wish and a group of supporters known as \"Elgin's Army,\" the turf field was requested at a board meeting in July 2023 and later added to the budget by the board in December 2023.\nAt a Board of Education work session in June, President Emily Jackson said while she's a \"vocal proponent\" of the turf field project, she wasn't committed to allocating funds towards it this fiscal cycle.\n\"I am not necessarily saying, no, never let's not do it,\" Jackson said. \"But I'm saying that I think there are a lot of questions to be asked. Is turf the best option? Should we be going with really high-quality grass instead? What is going to cause the least number of injuries?\"\nThe board has not made an official decision allocating the $1.5 million. Capital projects that are vying for the funding, such as new auditorium lights at Easton High and a playground replacement at St. Michaels Elementary, total to around $3.3 million.\nHawley believes if the district had acted sooner and actively partnered with Make-A-Wish, the $1.8 million estimate for the turf field could have been significantly lowered by donations, as well as a potential contribution from a turf field supplier.\n\"Having Make-A-Wish on our team … we could've gotten the field for much less,\" Hawley said.\nCounty Council Member Dave Stepp has been a proponent of the efforts of Elgin's Army and a potential turf field installation during the past year.\n\"Just from the overwhelming support of coaches and players who have shown up to express interest in how great that would be for our local athletes, I think that speaks for itself,\" Stepp said.\n\"I do know that they do have funds in reserve that they can make up the difference between the $1.5 (million) that we had given this fiscal year and the cost of the actual estimate,\" Stepp said regarding the Board of Education. \"So they can do that at any time they're ready to do so, and I'm optimistic that they will, and I hope so personally sooner than later.\"\nLesli Creedon, president and CEO of Make-A-Wish Mid-Atlantic, said the organization is fully committed to providing Elgin another wish. Creedon said the average wish granted by Make-A-Wish Mid-Atlantic is around $10,000, and that the foundation was prepared to contribute around that mark toward a turf field installation.\n\"While I am disappointed that the BOE passed in the partnership with Make-A-Wish and do think (it's) shortsighted, I am hopeful that the county and its citizens will do more to support its young athletes and instill pride in our public schools,\" Elgin Hawley said in an emailed statement to The Star Democrat. \"And whatever they decide they continue to think of me and my story to move the field forward as a priority.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You might also associate Jan. 6 with the political events of 2021.But Jan. 6 is actually the end of traditional 12 Days of Christmas celebrations.\nThe 12 days marks the birth of Jesus (Dec. 25) through the Coming of the Magi (the Three Wise Men).\nSome customs count the 12 days from sundown Dec. 25 until the morning of Jan. 6.\nEarly Christians celebrated Christmas on Jan. 6 until the Roman Empire moved the holiday to Dec. 25 in the 336 A.D. during the reign of Emperor Constantine. The late December date took the place of pagan holidays celebrating Roman gods and the Winter Solstice.\nStill, Jan 6. continued to be celebrated as Christmas by Britons and other Europeans in the Julian calendar.\nThe changeover to the Gregorian calendar in 1582 moved Christmas to Dec. 25 and closer to the Winter Solstice.\nIt was adopted by the British and Irish in 1752 which helped bring the calendar change to the American colonies.\nOther European countries, including Russia and its Eastern European neighbors, did not switch over until the early 20th Century. Orthodox Christians still celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7.\nStill, Jan. 6 holds a place in Christmas celebrations for Armenians, the Irish as well as folks in Appalachia and some Christian believers such as the Amish and Mennonites.\nArmenians - who are among the earliest in the Christian faith - still celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6.\nIn Ireland, the Jan. 6 celebrations have included women getting together for their own holiday festivities and the men of their households handling the cooking, cleaning and other chores for a day.\nIn Appalachia, Old Christmas still has a place for some with traditions such as getting together with family and friends, putting candles in windows and holiday food such as versions of fruitcakes (including apple stack cake), mincemeat pies and Christmas hams and serenading friends and neighbors.\nThere are also Appalachian superstitions that animals can speak at midnight on Old Christmas Day Jan. 6.\nThat superstition is on top Appalachians' holiday traditions such as eating ham hocks, black-eyed peas and greens on New Year's Day for good luck.\nThe Amish and Mennonites also celebrate Old Christmas with cakes, pies and other holiday foods as well as religious services. \n \n Caption: AP PHOTO/JENS MEYER\n\n Old Christmas is celebrated Jan. 6 in Appalachia and by the Amish, Mennonites, some Irish and other Christians. The birth of Jesus Christ was originally celebrated on Jan. 6 by many Europeans in the Julian calendar before being changed to Dec. 25. Jan. 6 is also the end of the 12 Days of Christmas, according to various customs.\n\n AP PHOTO/CZAREK SOKOLOWSKI\n\n Christmas was long celebrated on Jan. 6 in Great Britain, Ireland and other part of Europe until the changeover from the Julian to Gregorian calendars. Armenians still celebrate the birth of Jesus on Jan. 6 and Old Christmas is still commemorated in Appalachia and by the Amish and Mennonites. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On your right, South opens one heart, you pass (I assume!), North responds one notrump (forcing or nonforcing, it doesnâ€™t matter), partner doubles (a takeout double of hearts), and righty rebids two hearts.What would you do?This problem faced four players at Bridge Base Online. You might pass, but that seems a tad cautious.Once you decide to do something, which suit would you prefer to be trumps: hearts or clubs?It seems clear to me that the answer is hearts. You cannot even guarantee an eight-card club fit, and you would have to win nine tricks. If so, surely you can take six or seven tricks in a heart contract for plus 200 or 500. Note the vulnerability.All four BBO players advanced with three clubs.Nine other Wests saw South open two hearts and East double in fourth position.Everyone ran to three clubs (using Lebensohl to warn of a weak hand).Now look at the full deal.How do two hearts and three clubs fareftIf the defenders are careful against two hearts doubled, they can take one spade, two hearts, two diamonds, one club and a diamond ruff for down two, plus 500.However, it isnâ€™t so straightforward. The play might well begin diamond, diamond, diamond ruff, a club to the king and another diamond. Then, though, South discards his spade loser and escapes for down one. East must shift swiftly to a spade, which is not obvious.Still, plus 200 would have been a cold top! \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She is definitely at the top of the list for a rookie of the year award.\nIf there was any fear of a drop-off with new leadership, Kilmon put those fears to rest and set a high bar for success in coming years.\n\"We know we broke every record we've ever broken,\" Kilmon said on Monday.\n\"We had the highest attendance ever,\" Kilmon said. \"It's hard for us to gauge because not everyone buys a ticket. But we do know that every parking space was full and every bus had about 45 minutes to an hourlong wait, and we had to add three buses on Saturday to accommodate the people.\"\nKilmon got a helping hand from Mother Nature who blessed the weekend with lovely weather and temperatures approaching 80 degrees under sunny skies for several of the days.\nThe executive director said multiple vendors — many of whom are already asking about next year — sold out or had record days at the festival.\nIf you have a 2025 calendar already, mark the weekend of Nov. 14-16 for the 54th Waterfowl Festival. We have no doubt that Kilmon will improve upon the tremendous success of this year's festival.\nThe success of the Waterfowl Festival is a success for the town of Easton and Talbot County too.\nDowntown Easton shops were packed all three days of the festival, and restaurants had waiting lists for tables.\nKilmon called the relationship between the festival and local businesses \"incredibly important.\"\n\"We're symbiotic,\" she said. \"So if they succeed, we succeed and vice versa.\"\nThe three-day festival has an economic impact of more than $3 million each year, Kilmon said. It benefits hotels, restaurants, retailers and even local nonprofits.\n\"It's typically one of the biggest fundraising events of the year because a lot of the food vendors and people involved in the festival, they are nonprofits,\" Kilmon said. \"And they're allowed to keep their proceeds, so it's extremely important to a lot of people.\"\nAt a breakfast Friday morning, Talbot County Economic Development and Tourism Director Cassadra Vanhooser extolled the virtues of the business community that makes the \"wonderful things\" that happen in the county possible.\n\"It's that private investment along with the public investment that builds the community,\" she said. \"And it's the festivals like the Waterfowl Festival — the granddaddy of them all — that weaves that fabric of the quality of life that we all love so much.\"\nThe festival may have just celebrated its 53rd anniversary, but it continues to grow and evolve.\nThroughout the festival venues music filled the air and complemented the many duck and geese calls typical of the festival. Overall there were 38 musical acts on multiple stages.\n\"That made the festival have a different vibe this year, I think,\" Kilmon said, \"just made it more of a friendly family party on every corner.\"\nFeedback has been \"incredibly positive,\" and Kilmon is excited to begin work on continuing Easton's Waterfowl tradition.\n\"Fifty-three years of our community coming together just gets better every year,\" Kilmon said. \"And we're already working on next year, believe it or not.\"\nIt is good that Kilmon and her team are already working on the 2025 show. This year's show will be tough to top. We have no doubt they will rise to the challenge. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County considering new cannabis legislation\n\n July 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 523\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County is reviewing regulations on cannabis operations, but drafted legislation drew concerns from prospective business owners at a recent meeting.As drafted, legislation would bar cannabis growing and processing operations from locating within 500 feet of residential properties. That mark could be reduced for a specific project only if all property owners within that radius agree.\nAt a County Council meeting on July 8, a public hearing on the legislation was opened, during which two state license holders raised concerns. Discussion centered on changing the 500-foot setback to 200 feet.\nDave Ferraris, winner of a cannabis-processing license from the Maryland Cannabis Administration, which are awarded via a lottery, said the proposed restrictions would be \"detrimental.\"\n\"It's not the wild west,\" Ferraris said of cannabis operations. \"It's agriculture with oversight.\"\nEaston resident Lori Yates received a license for cultivation. She said on July 8 that passage of the county legislation would hinder her progress toward acquiring a property in Cordova, the now-closed Triple Creek Winery.\n\"It really would pull the rug out from us trying to work with the current owners,\" Yates said.\nOn the prospect of a 200-foot setback, Yates said she feels it would still allow for proper space \"to have it off of the public access road.\"\nBrennan Tarleton, the county's planning and zoning director, noted that in the original draft legislation, there's already a written-in opportunity to reduce the setback to 200 feet if the affected property owners agree. But he said moving the starting point down from 500 feet is a possibility.\n\"Two hundred feet isn't a pie-in-the-sky idea for a setback,\" Tarleton said.\nIf passed, the legislation would require processors and growers to obtain site plan approval from the county and operate on a lot of at least 20 acres. Additionally, operators must procure professional testimony that cannabis odor is not \"detectible from adjacent properties or public rights-of-way.\"\nFerraris voiced opposition to the \"no odors\" regulation, citing it is too extreme of a rule.\n\"Talbot County will realistically and effectively be disqualified from participating in cannabis processing and growing endeavors,\" Ferraris said.\nHe added that prospective cannabis operators aren't looking to exploit the county. \"We're not asking for a blank check. We're just asking for a fair chance,\" he said.\nTarleton noted the county mostly mirrored Easton's cannabis ordinance in regard to the odor requirement. He said Easton restricted to just indoor growing operations, though. Tarleton said council could consider exempting open-air growing operations from the \"no odors\" rule.\nTalbot's draft cannabis legislation also lays out standards for cannabis dispensaries to follow, largely falling in line with the state's recent legislation effective in July, 2024.\nDispensaries cannot be located within 500 feet of schools, child care centers, playgrounds, recreation centers, libraries, public parks or places of worship. They also can't locate within 1,000 feet of one another; that standard is present in Easton town limits, too, and in one case created competition between businesses.\nWhile Talbot County's potential regulations stick with the state, local jurisdictions are permitted under state law to change those distance requirements.\nThe county's cannabis legislation wasn't eligible for a vote on July 8. It may return to the council at its July 22 meeting or later in August. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "New exhibition at AAM features artist Darlene R. Taylor\n\n April 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Entertainment \n \n 613\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A new art exhibition from multidisciplinary artist Darlene R. Taylor has debuted at the Academy Art Museum in Easton.The HEIRLOOMS exhibition runs through July 14.\nTaylor is an artist who is based in Washington D.C. and the Eastern Shore.\n\"In HEIRLOOMS, Darlene R. Taylor (b. 1960) affirms the resonance of memory in material culture as she imagines portraits of Black women obscured in historical archives. History is a muse that guides Taylor to know the past from the women who lived it. HEIRLOOMS examines the presence of Black women in Maryland's Talbot County communities and Taylor's own ancestry and follows the artist's experience researching and interpreting photographs found in archives and family albums. Taylor employs mixed-media collage using vintage linens, laces, cottons, and buttons collected and handed down from mother to daughter, friend to friend,\" according to an announcement from the museum.\n\"I've been using antique textiles for some time, many of which I found in antique stores locally in Maryland. But the works in HEIRLOOMS have an even more resonant history. I had been thinking about the way the handkerchief holds so many emotions and experiences—sweat and tears, joy and sadness. When I shared that thought with my friend circle, they responded by giving me handkerchiefs and linens passed down through their own families. In this way, my work is becoming its own archive of Black women's lives. The cloth holds memory, and when it is given to me, I am connected to an ancestor through that exchange,\" Taylor said.\nAccording to AAM:\n\"Her use of women's personal effects also draws inspiration in part from artifacts unearthed during two excavations commissioned by the Museum at the former home of Henny and James Freeman, one of the earliest- documented free Black landowning families who lived on the Hill Community site from 1787-1828. This site was gifted to AAM in 2023, and the Museum has plans to rehabilitate the existing structure on the site and connect it to new construction of an annex that will provide needed administrative space, as well as commemorate the historical significance of Easton's Hill Community. Part of the annex will be named The Henny and James Freeman Wing and showcase the objects unearthed from the excavations in outdoor displays that tell the story of the family and neighborhood. Of the more than 6,000 historical artifacts unearthed, the most remarkable finds were personal items including buttons, jewelry, children's toys, a woman's shoe buckle, and a hair comb. These unique objects offer a rare connection to Black domestic life in the eighteenth century— particularly the lives of Black women and children, whose stories were frequently lost to history.\"\n\"In trying to imagine these lives, I am always asking what is behind each woman's gaze. Much of my work is based on photographs of women I find in historic archives. Even though we can see their faces, we often know more about the objects pictured in the room than we do about the women. So I try to stand with each woman, to look at what she is looking at. I'm not staring at her; I'm seeing the world as she sees it and observing those elements that make up her world,\" said Taylor.\nA handmade paperback book HEIRLOOMS is available for purchase in AAM's Museum Shop as well as a limited-edition fine art print of the image The Storyteller with an excerpt of the poem Porch Telling written by Darlene R. Taylor.\n\"Taylor's HEIRLOOMS stitches together the forgotten stories of Black women, weaving memory and material into a vibrant tapestry of resilience and remembrance. We are thrilled to showcase Taylor's beautiful works on paper and to amplify voices that have historically been silenced,\" said. interim director Jennifer Chrzanowski. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Natural Resources Police use thermal imaging to rescue lost kayaker in Talbot County\n\n July 9, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 344\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n BROAD CREEK — Police and firefighters teamed to locate a lost juvenile kayaker last weekend in Talbot County.On July 4 around 10 p.m., Maryland Natural Resources Police were informed of a lost kayaker in the Broad Creek area, which is on the west side of the county south of St. Michaels. Officials said he was on the water for \"several hours\" and around three miles from home.\nUsing thermal imaging cameras, a Natural Resource Police aviation unit quickly found the lost person — in around five minutes, according to Sgt. John Buchanan, chief pilot for NRP. Buchanan was in the aircraft with tactical flight officer Christian Helwig.\nBuchanan said the kayaker left out of Grace Creek.\n\"I think it got dark on him, and he didn't know where he was,\" Buchanan said.\nOnce located, police used a spotlight to direct a rescue boat from the Tilghman Island Volunteer Fire Company toward the juvenile.\nA video posted to Facebook by Natural Resource Police shows the aircraft hone in on the kayaker and direct the fire boat to retrieve the juvenile.\nBuchanan said such a rescue isn't too common, but it become somewhat prominent during boating season.\n\"(The) Chesapeake Bay and the tributaries are very large,\" Buchanan said. \"When you start thinking about the different rivers and creeks and stuff off the Chesapeake Bay, we go out on different search missions like that probably a few times a month.\"\nThe pilot emphasized Helwig's expertise is crucial to such rescues. Helwig handles the thermal imaging camera, which can expose subjects in dark conditions, as well as a mapping system to pull up addresses and latitudes and longitudes.\n\"He's gotten really good with it, he's worked really hard at it,\" Buchanan said. \"He's made us as a team very successful going out and doing these search missions.\"\nBuchanan advises those going out on the water, especially alone, to be prepared with a charged cell phone and other equipment in case of emergency.\n\"Have a life jacket if you're out at night,\" he said. \"Obviously have some kind of flashlight. And know the area, that's probably the biggest thing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I've engaged in them all, and I value each for the lessons they teach. Losing, when it happens, can even make you stronger.In debate or sport, you must prepare. You must know your opponent's strengths and weaknesses, and you must have a strategy. And win or lose, you are judged not only by the outcome but by how you carry yourself. I learned long ago: You lose with honor, but you win with grace.\nSo I ask — where has grace gone? Where has decorum gone? Today it seems acceptable to shout down opponents, to sneer and label, to point fingers instead of making points. These are tactics we would scold in children, yet they are now common currency in our politics.\nI always valued the end of a contest, when you could shake hands, smile and respect the person across from you — even if you didn't like them. The best opponent was never the one I agreed with, but the one I could respect.\nThe true test of character, in debate or in life, is simple: Would I welcome this person as my next-door neighbor? Increasingly, I fear too many of today's loudest voices would fail that test.\nDAN McKEW\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The parade took just over 20 minutes, which seemed like a long time for many of the children as temperatures reached the mid-80s.\nBrian Collison and his 14-year-old daughter, Constance, stood on a downtown corner, Brian playing patriotic songs on his trumpet with Constance accompanying him on the drums. The Collisons came from Denver, Colorado, to visit relatives in St. Michaels over the holiday weekend.\nFour friends from Crofton came to St. Michaels, the third time they marched in the parade. The four — Megan Elias, Ellie Cockrell, Taylor Sundick and Ella Davis — painted their faces red, white and blue.\n\"We love being patriotic,\" Sundick said.\nFollowing the parade a traditional Fourth of July program was held on the museum lawn starting with the Scout troop raising the flag and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The program included patriotic and folk songs.\nThe Fourth of July weekend in St. Michaels concluded Saturday with Big Band Night at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum followed by fireworks at dusk. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed sees initial budget proposal\n\n January 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 720\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot Board of Education had its first look at the district's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 Monday.During a board work session Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones presented the draft budget, which totals $85.8 million in unrestricted dollars — an $8.6 million increase from fiscal year 2025, Jones noted.\nJones provided the year-to-year budget changes by looking at 12 different categories of expenditures. The areas in which increases were highest are fixed charges ($2.23 million increase), instructional salaries ($1.7 million increase) and other instructional costs ($1.47 million increase).\nJones added that while $9 million to $10 million in grants are expected next year, anticipated grant funding is more than $5 million less than last fiscal year. That drop in grant funding precipitated a portion of the rise in the requested unrestricted budget.\nIn Annapolis, it still remains to be seen how Maryland's expected $2.7 billion deficit is tackled and if legislative decisions will impact funding for The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's education improvement and funding initiative.\nTalbot school leaders say budgeting will be a fluid process in the coming months as they keep an eye on state legislation and the Accountability & Implementation Board, an entity that ensures the state and county governments are correctly implementing Blueprint.\n\"There's one area where I did do a little bit of hedging our bets, on the conservative side,\" Jones said of the proposed budget. \"I don't think we'll know any of that until April or May. But as certain pieces of legislation gather steam and seem to gather support and seem likely, then I think we will work behind the scenes to figure out how we will address this if this comes to fruition.\"\nIn creating the draft budget, Jones and Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi emphasized that the district considered its top priorities: academic equity in math, an engaging environment for students and staff, recruitment and retention levels, and meeting Blueprint objectives.\nMonday's discussion included a breakdown of 33 proposed additional positions for the next fiscal year. The proposed budget includes a $3.6 million jump in salaries and wages.\n\"This list is whittled down, if you can believe it, from a longer list of wants and desires,\" Jones said. \"And it was very much informed by school administration. This is what they felt they needed in their buildings.\"\nADDITIONAL POSITIONSJones outlined the 33 additional positions that are in the requested budget. Six of those positions are for English for Speakers of Other Languages teachers, assistants or coaches.\nShe cited the district's need to serve its multilingual population, along with the state funding for multilingual learning, for adding the positions.\n\"Our (Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program) data … demonstrates that we do consistently underserve our multilingual students,\" Jones said. \"And so, we just need to provide more resources there.\"\nBoard of Education President Emily Jackson asked if those English for Speakers of Other Languages positions will be difficult to fill.\n\"Because I know we've had problems — specifically with ESOL in the past — finding people who are qualified and had a desire to do that,\" Jackson said. \"And that's a quarter of the positions we're looking for.\"\nZulieka Jarmon-Horsey, assistant superintendent of administrative services, systems and strategies, said it's a challenge both in Talbot County and statewide. She said recruitment and retention are key aspects.\n\"We have to definitely start promoting earlier and just doing the best that we can,\" Jarmon-Horsey said. \"And doing things that are unconventional, like our on-site career fair that's going to be happening here this week.\"\nOther requested positions in the budget include: an art teacher at Easton Middle, a high school math coach, a middle school reading coach, four special education positions at Easton Elementary and a special education teacher at Easton Middle.\nOne athletic trainer to serve Easton High School and St. Michaels Middle High School was also on the proposed list.\n\"I'm happy to see that at the top of the list,\" Jackson said of the athletic trainer role. \"I would be in favor of two … making sure that we have coverage for all of our athletic events. I know sports parents, they have eyes on that.\"\nThe draft budget will be discussed again at Wednesday's monthly Board of Education meeting before the board hosts its joint meeting with the Talbot County Council on Jan. 22. On Feb. 10, the board will host a public hearing on the budget. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The group is committed to sharing its passion and knowledge of rowing to anyone interested in learning.\nESCR has scheduled two free information sessions: April 12 and April 19 from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. at Evergreen 770 Port Street. The sessions will be a chance to meet coaches and team members, learn about the 60-foot, eight-person rowing shells to singles, and how rowing is a super fun, sweaty good time.\nESCR will host two full Learn-to-Row clinics, April 28-May 1, from 5:30-7:30 p.m., and Saturday, May 3, from 8:30-10:30 a.m. Clinics will also be offered May 12-15 from 5:30-7:30 p.m., and Saturday, May 17, from 8:30-10:30 a.m. The cost is $400 for these 10-hour sessions.\nESCR is dedicated to teaching our community to row and offer more access area rivers.

Beginners are encouraged to join the Learn-To-Row clinics, or to take private lessons from one of ESCR's accredited rowing coaches to acquire the skills needed for practices.\n\"The only criteria,\" said Board Safety Officer Terry Gleim, \"is that you be able to swim and (are) strong enough to properly hold an oar. If swimming is an obstacle, ESCR will assist in helping you learn.\"\nThe rowing season runs from April-December with afternoon sessions for novices, 5:30 p.m. workouts Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and 7 p.m. rows on Tuesday and Thursday for more advanced rowers. There will also be a 7:30 a.m. row on Saturdays for all members.\n\"ESCR is open to anyone over 18 interested in having fun, getting healthy, and appreciating our beautiful waters,\" said Chloe Tong, the executive director. \"The health of our rivers, as well as personal health, is an intrinsic part of our conversation.\"\nAs a non-profit, ESCR raises money through private donations, grants, and modest membership dues needed to fund the additional boats and necessary equipment for next year's rowing season.\nFor more information visit www.ESCRowers.org, or email head coach Chloe Allen: Director@escrowers.org \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County Democrats marked election night with celebration of campaign efforts\n\n November 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 691\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Cheers filled the BAAM Center on election night as dozens of local Democrats watched votes roll in for the 2024 general election and celebrated the end of a highly divisive election campaign.To be in community among like-minded residents, Talbot Democrats hosted an election watch party filled with food, drinks, guests dressed in their best campaign gear and deep discussion about hopes and fears for the future.\nPatrick Firth, chair of the Talbot County Democratic Central Committee, said this celebration was needed for the community on the Shore. Firth said the people gathered on Tuesday are the heartbeat of the Democratic community and more than anything deserved a celebration and to feel appreciated for all their work.\n\"We had a record of over 200 individual volunteers helping us throughout the election, from greeting voters to canvassing, to phone banking,\" Firth said. \"Talbot led the Eastern Shore this past weekend in canvassing, knocking on over 1000 doors in Talbot County.\"\nLined around the room were political signs showing support for Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks and Talbot County candidate for Board of Education Candace Henry.\nKathy Hostetter, resident of Wye Mills, said she was feeling hopeful Tuesday night though she understood the presidential race would be close. Hostetter shared her enthusiasm for Alsobrooks, who hours later would win a U.S. Senate Seat in Maryland.\n\"Talbot County is one of the most beautiful places,\" Hostetter said. \"We have a great state here in Maryland, we've got a great blue state. So tonight, we're very hopeful, and we want to keep it blue.\"\nHours after the party ended, former president Donald Trump triumphed over Democratic opponent Kamala Harris. Though initially expected to be a close race, Trump flipped several swing states in his favor and won the popular vote for the first time as a candidate.\nElection night was a mix of triumphs and defeats for Democrats in Maryland. Alsobrooks claimed victory over incumbent Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan. Additionally, Maryland voters overwhelmingly supported an amendment to Maryland's constitution for reproductive freedom.\nMichele Dappert, president of the Talbot County Democrat Party, said though Maryland is a famously blue state, this year's election has divided voters, especially in Talbot County.\nAccording to the State Board of Elections' unofficial 2024 General Election Results for Talbot County, over half of voters chose former President Donald Trump as their presidential candidate and an overwhelming number of residents voted for Republican candidate Larry Hogan for U.S. Senate.\nDappert said though there is political separation among those on the Eastern Shore, all voters have essentially the same end goal: to have their values understood, heard and put into practice.\n\"Look, I get it, politics can be contentious, but when you meet people locally at the door, most of us are just trying to get by, and we're just trying to send our kids to school, have clean water, be able to walk outside and feel safe no matter what you look like and who you are,\" Dappert said. \"And those are all very universal values, so I find it very important to defend them.\"\nSitting next to Dappert in a Kamala Harris camo cap and a blue shirt, which showed \"CLXXVII Minutes\" on the front and \"11,780 Votes\" on the back, was her father George Dappert. George Dappert explained the meaning behind his shirt.\nThe front represented, in roman numerals, the 186 minutes Trump watched TV during the Jan. 6 insurrection. The back represented the number of votes Trump was trying to find in Georgia to turn the state in his favor during the 2020 Presidential Election.\nGeorge Dappert said the Democratic Party has done everything they could in terms of getting out to vote, talking to people and getting the message out there for others to vote. For him, practicing the political right of voting is essential to democracy and he urges everyone to continue to be politically active regardless of major elections.\n\"It is what generations of our forefathers and foremothers have fought for, bled for, marched for, done everything that they could,\" George Dappert said. \"To willfully not vote is an abdication of your responsibility and what they have given from their past to our future.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Experts discuss Mid-Shore impacts of human trafficking\n\n April 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 751\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Around 180 people attended the For All Seasons presentation on human trafficking on Tuesday night at the Avalon Theatre, where a panel of experts painted a picture of a changing landscape for trafficking crimes.With the increasing use of social media, traffickers find and groom their victims at home, a more methodical trust-gaining method than before the advent of the internet, they said.\nAccording to Thomas Stack, anti-human trafficking and sexual assault response manager for Mayor's Neighborhood Office of Safety and Engagement for the City of Baltimore, because young people's lives are so transparent online, traffickers can target individuals who are alone, mad at their parents and not doing well in school. Low self esteem is the target, he said.\n\"It is all about getting the word out there. Human trafficking has been around a long time, but the awareness has probably only been around for the last 20 years,\" Stack said. \"Maryland has a toxic mixture of both poverty and wealth. The poverty is a major risk factor for exploitation and the wealth is the buyers of sex, the people who are willing to purchase people for their pleasure.\"\nMaryland is also geographically vulnerable to trafficking, the experts said.\n\"We are two hours from Philly, three hours from New York, we have a lot of sporting events, we have two major cities, and we have airports and casinos, everything a trafficker wants,\" Stack said. \"Like we have the Preakness coming up. There will be a lot of males who have traveled here. The traffickers know that and will bring their victims of sex trafficking to service those males.\"\nThe speakers made it clear that human trafficking happens in the Mid-Shore community.\n\"There was a 15-year-old trafficked in Denton, so it is here,\" Stack said.\nBy becoming more aware of the problem, they said, community members can identify victims and reach out.\nHeather Amador, deputy director of victim services policy and programs for the Governor's Office of Crime Prevention and Policy, was one of the speakers. She said members of the community can look for signs of trafficking, like bruises, new tattoos and new suggestive clothing.\nRed flags can also appear online, Stack said, like if a teenager has multiple Facebook profiles with some that have nothing to do with their family or friends.\n\"Human trafficking is here. People don't want to believe that their neighbors are capable of such things,\" Amador said. \"A lot of human trafficking victims don't even identify as a victim. They see themselves as voluntarily engaging in it. They don't see the coercion that goes along with it. They are deceived to go down this path or forced into addiction. They think they are helping someone else out.\"\nAmador had one victim in her office who simply said she needed to make money. She was a runaway and had nowhere to go, Amador said, and she needed housing.\nAmador came across a case where a child had to perform a sex act to get lunch money in her lunch account and emphasized that that is trafficking too.\nFor All Seasons offers a host of services around human trafficking, from trainings, to getting the word out, to psychological services, to addiction services.\nBeth Anne Dorman, CEO and president of For All Seasons, says it takes a village to combat trafficking.\n\"Our anti-human trafficking efforts focused on a team-based approach,\" she said. \"We collaborate with law enforcement, first responders, Department of Social Services, child advocacy centers, school administrators, teachers and the hospital, officials from the towns and counties we serve.\"\nThen she introduced a video of Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, who created and helped pass legislation to make the Maryland Regional Navigator program when she was a legislator. This program supports survivors of trafficking. For All Seasons is a participant.\n\"Maryland recorded 118 cases of human trafficking involving 173 victims. This figure includes sex and labor exploitation. Child sex trafficking is also a concern. Since 2012 over 500 children have been identified by Child Protective Services as reportedly being trafficked in Maryland. This remains vastly under reported,\" Lierman said in the video.\nShe said she was committed to ensuring access to services for every survivor of sex trafficking in Maryland. She highlighted For All Seasons as \"essential to the safety and wellness of our communities.\"\nThe night ended with a call to action for the audience.\n\"It is a hidden crime so we all have to be alert,\" said Susan Ahlstrom, regional navigator at For All Seasons. \"We all have to be vigilant.\"\nFor more information on human trafficking and available resources, visit missingkids.org, polaris.com and netsmartz.com \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Republicans continue to push Talbot Board of Elections on election judge breakdown\n\n October 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 775\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — County Republicans continued to push the Talbot County Board of Elections to equal its selection of election judges during the board's monthly meeting on Wednesday morning.The breakdown by party was 62 Democratic judges, 50 Republican judges and 11 unaffiliated judges in September, according to Election Director Tammy Stafford. Local officials have indicated at meetings that the number of judges for each party may now be closer to equal, but this has not been confirmed by the Board of Elections.\nElection officials have said the makeup is \"fluid\" and will change up until Election Day. During Wednesday's meeting, Stafford said \"judges are always needed\" and that her office \"continuously\" accepts interest forms.\nAccording to Sept. 18 meeting minutes read aloud Wednesday, staffing for the election began in June of 2023. Training for those who filled out interest forms began in early 2024.\nIn the last month, concerns have circulated regarding a party imbalance of election judges, or those who staff polling places on Election Day.\nLocal officials, including Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble and Talbot County Council Member Dave Stepp, have cited that the board is not in compliance with state law.\nMaryland election code states \"each polling place shall have an equal number of election judges\" from \"the majority party\" and \"the principal minority party.\"\nState election law permits judges not affiliated with either party for precincts with six or more judges, as well as \"one or more election judges who are minors.\" The number of unaffiliated judges \"may not exceed the lesser of\" the majority or minority party, law states.\nThese concerns led to a flurry of responses from state agencies emphasizing the security of the electoral process. In an Oct. 2 statement responding to a letter sent by Gamble to the Talbot Board of Elections, State Board of Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis said voters should feel \"confident\" in the state's election security and \"compliance with the law.\"\nAttorney General Anthony Brown weighed in as well, writing a letter to Gamble on Oct. 7.\n\"Even at the individual polling place level, while all local boards make best efforts to achieve exact party balance, this is not always possible for reasons outside the local board's control, including the number of judges from each party who volunteer,\" Brown wrote.\nStafford stated at the Sept. 18 meeting that the training for election judges can no longer be done after Oct. 8 since the room used for training is also used for canvassing.\nDuring Wednesday's public comment, Gary Judy, a member of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee, said he's heard from Republicans who applied to be an election judge but were not told there are no vacancies for this year's general election. He said the fact that the board did not achieve exact party balance is \"extremely alarming to Talbot County voters.\"\n\"We decided to keep close track on it this year,\" Judy said, \"and can confirm that there were more than enough Republicans who signed up to be election judges to fill the available Republican positions of the equal representation required by Maryland election law.\"\nOn Wednesday, Judy provided board members with copies of a letter written by the Maryland Republican Party addressing election judge concerns in Talbot County. Adam Wood, executive director of the Maryland Republican Party, later told the Star Democrat that the letter was a \"draft\" letter and had not been sent to the state board.\nShari Wilcoxon, also a member of the Republican central committee, spoke during public comment, asking the board to ensure \"parity\" of election judges.\n\"I think that it is an actual embarrassment that this board is allowing the executive director free rein to break the law,\" Wilcoxon said. \"It is your duty to hold her feet to the fire, and that she does what is Maryland law.\"\nWilcoxon questioned why election judge applications were denied in February and March.\n\"February and March had to do with the primary,\" Stafford responded. \"Let's be specific here. That was the primary. Those were the first people who were contacted for the general (election).\"\nThis led to tense back-and-forth between Wilcoxon and Stafford.\nBoard President Susan MacKinnon stepped in, asking Wilcoxon to stop speaking.\n\"You have had the opportunity to speak, you are now being disruptive,\" MacKinnon said to Wilcoxon. \"You are being disruptive, and if you continue being disruptive, I will call a recess and have you removed.\"\nWednesday's meeting was the board's last regularly scheduled meeting before the election Nov. 5. During Stafford's report to the board, she said \"logic and accuracy testing on the electronic equipment was completed\" on Sept. 16. The Board of Elections will have its logic and accuracy testing documentation available for public inspection Friday at 10 a.m. at 215 Bay Street in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — Hundreds of people enjoyed boat docking contests, steamed local crabs, live music and family activities to celebrate the 13th annual Watermen's Appreciation Day hosted at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum on Sunday.Watermen's Appreciation Day brings people together to celebrate the longstanding history of watermen on the Eastern Shore, as well as fundraise for the Talbot Watermen's Association.\nJeff Harrison, president of the association, said the event began in 2010 and has grown throughout the years. For Harrison, the number of people attending every year shows the local community's support for watermen.\n\"There is this appreciation for the local watermen in this area and, of course, all over the Bay,\" Harrison said. \"And we are actually trying to grab a hold of that in some of our fundraisers and to let people know that we do appreciate them and that we're glad that they appreciate us also.\"\nHarrison, dressed in a yellow volunteer shirt, was part of a team of over a 100 volunteers assisting attendees and contestants.\nThe Harrison family were all part of the volunteer team. Ashley and James Harrison, along with a group of five boys under the age of 13, stood behind a volunteer table near crowded bleachers awaiting the boat docking competition.\nAshley Harrison said volunteering at the Watermen Appreciation Day event is a family tradition she married into and has decided to establish in her family. This tradition stems from her husband, who comes from a family of watermen and who began volunteering when he was a young boy.\n\"We like doing stuff for the children,\" Ashley Harrison said. \"We have three of our own, and we love seeing them have fun at events as well. And we like helping our community and showing our visitors that come here that this is a really great place to come and we're a tight knit community.\"\nUnder the sun, hundreds of people crowded and squeezed together to catch a glimpse of the boat docking contest. Boat owners of all ages showed off their skills and embraced cheers and support from the crowd.\nShannon Mitchell, vice president of engagement for the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, said this event is a part of a partnership between the museum and local watermen to benefit the watermen in their fundraising, sponsorship and silent auction work. The museum benefits from the admission intake, she said.\n\"This one is very much mission-focused in supporting our local watermen,\" Mitchell said. \"It's a big piece of why the museum exists to begin with. They tell a big story about the Chesapeake Bay and our region, so it's really exciting to see everyone come out and support them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It was an upsetting moment, and I just did what I could to help both in terms of the emotions of the folks as well as the physical reality of the situation,\" he said Sunday morning.\nThe fire, which involved a second-floor closet at the Y, was one of two that the Easton Volunteer Fire Department and other departments responded to at the YMCA Saturday, according to Easton Fire Chief JR Dobson.\nAt around 5:30 p.m., firefighters were once again called to the Y, where an HVAC unit was on fire on the building's roof.\nNeither fire resulted in any extensive damage to the building, according to YMCA of the Chesapeake CEO Robbie Gill.\nDobson said the first fire was extinguished by the Y's sprinkler system before firefighters arrived at the scene. The second fire was quickly extinguished by firefighters using a fire extinguisher after gas feeding the HVAC unit was shut off, the fire chief said.\nThe fires closed the Y for the remainder of Saturday, but regular operations resumed Sunday morning with all facilities but the racquetball courts open for use. The racquetball courts were largely undamaged, Gill said, but due to their proximity to the first fire, a sprinkler had gone off over them, meaning they had to be closed Sunday while staff worked to dry the area.\n\"We were fortunate there wasn't a substantial amount of damage to the building,\" Gill said. \"And now we're working with local authorities to provide any information we can to help them investigate.\"\nWhile the second fire's cause was ruled by the Office of the State Fire Marshal to have been a mechanical failure with the HVAC unit, Dobson said, the cause of the first fire is still under investigation.\nGill said the first fire is not believed to have been caused by any mechanical or similar failure.\nThough the fires did not cause extensive damage to the facilities, Hyman said the events were particularly upsetting for Y staff and regulars because of the role the YMCA plays in the Easton community.\n\"We're lucky,\" he said. \"Our YMCA is not just a place to work out and exercise. It really is a community. It's a very wonderful group of people… I've been a member of the Y for years, and it really is a community across cultures, all kinds of folks. And it's a really special place.\"\nDobson said multiple departments, including the Easton, Oxford and Trappe volunteer fire departments and Talbot County Emergency Services, responded to the events Saturday. These departments worked with staff and others on the scene to evacuate the building and secure the area.\nGill said although Saturday was \"a little bit of a traumatic day,\" the coordinated community response to the fires served as a reminder of the importance of the YMCA.\n\"The Y has been around for 168 years, so it's an institution in the community that serves one in three people, and it's wonderful to see so many people care for it at that level,\" Gill said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'How Lucky Is This Community' - Connect Talbot Project Celebrated For Its Success\n\n September 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; Njones@Chespub.Com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 856\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n CORDOVA - More than 60 representatives from the U.S. Department of Agriculture took a field trip to the Eastern Shore Wednesday to celebrate the continued progress of Easton Utilities' Connect Talbot project.Headed by Easton Utilities, the Connect Talbot project is extending broadband to unserved portions of Talbot County. The USDA provided significant initial support for the rural connectivity initiative in July 2020 when the agency awarded Easton Utilities $13.1 million in grant funding for the project.Wednesday's activities kicked off at Triple Creek Winery in Cordova, where USDA representatives took in technical demonstrations and checked out stations designed to show broadband deployment.Guests enjoyed a hands-on experience with field crews showcasing their work, including all components from initial construction techniques, plowing, drilling, aerial lashing and the installation process connecting service to the side of the home.Demonstrations were followed by a customer panel sharing the positive impacts of broadband service made possible by the Connect Talbot and lunch on the winery grounds.In the afternoon, federal, state and local officials gathered to praise Connect Talbot's progress so far.Laurel Leverrier, the assistant administrator of the USDA's rural utility service telecommunications program, expressed gratitude for the opportunity to see the work being done on the ground in Talbot County - the first trip of its kind for her.\"It's very clear being here and meeting with you all and hearing from folks that you're serving of what a community focus your organization has,\" she said of Easton Utilities. \"I think part of it is the type of entity you are - you're municipally owned and operated I think it's really unique, and I think, 'How lucky is this community to get to benefit from the services you provide.'\" Sen. Johnny Mautz, R-37, emphasized the significance of prioritizing broadband accessibility for children in Talbot County.\"To put the power of the internet in the hands of our children is just phenomenal.And the investment that's been made; when we first talked about this, it would never pay for itself, you can't get the revenue or return out of the investment and what you're putting in - that's very true, that's not going to happen right away,\" he said. \"But I will guarantee you over the years, we will see benefits beyond anyone's imagination for what you've been able to do for our area.\"Mautz thanked the USDA for providing supplemental funding for the project, the cost of which has now risen significantly.Talbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher acknowledged that prior to the project's kickoff, the county's 37,000 residents were divided between \"digital haves and digital have nots.\" But with the USDA funding and efforts from local government and Easton Utilities, rural addresses across the county are being connected.\"This is our proudest moment,\" he said. \"This is delivering on the American promise of a land of equal opportunity. This is transforming the lives in our community.This is creating prosperity in our corner of rural America.\"Also expressing gratitude was Easton Mayor Megan Cook, who emphasized the importance of the infrastructure in providing rural residents with connectivity and accessibility to enjoy the benefits of education, social interaction, health care, remote work, entertainment and more.\"Connectivity, interconnectedness, support, community - these are all pieces of the same puzzle, and they all become more important with each passing day,\" she said. \"It's our ability to look out for each other, and help where and when we can, to reap what we sow - that is truly essential.\"Easton Velocity has made significant progress installing and providing broadband service to significant portions of Talbot County.As of early September, Easton Velocity has completed more than 50% of the mileage construction mileage and offered access to more than 1,750 locations.According to Easton Utilities, 920 of these locations have already subscribed to service and are enjoying the benefits internet service offers.Since the initial grant funding in 2020, various grant funding sources now total over $30 million. The project will now provide access to 4,400 locations and is estimated to cost $40 million.The scope and timeline of the project are reflected on a real-time interactive map.The project is on track for completion in advance of the grant requirement deadline of Dec. 31, 2026, according to Ted L. Book, vice president of Easton Velocity.Hugh Grunden, Easton Utilities' president and CEO, closed out the celebration with appreciation for the wider community effort to bring broadband to the county's rural areas.\"It's about partnerships - we could not have done this alone, the county couldn't have done it alone,\" he said.\"So when you partner with the likes of the USDA, the state of Maryland, Talbot County, the Town of Easton, Easton Utilities, whether it be for the engineering, the funding or the execution, that's how it works.\" \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nEaston Mayor Megan Cook speaks to a crowd gathered to celebrate the progress of the Connect Talbot project.\n \nNATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nRepresentatives from the USDA, Easton Utilities and state and local governments gathered to celebrate the progress of the Connect Talbot initiative.\n \nNATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nHugh Grunden, president and CEO of Easton Utilities, speaks to a crowd celebrating the Connect Talbot project's progress. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I'm writing to relay my recent firsthand experience with our local health care system.On Aug. 17, I experienced symptoms of a stroke and called 911. The ambulance arrived within minutes, and the EMT assessed my symptoms as a suspected stroke. They asked me if I had a preference of where they took me, and I asked their recommendation. Based on the severity of my symptoms they suggested University of Maryland Medical System Chester River Hospital. The EMT remained vigilant through the entire trip.\nDr. Lukas met us in the vestibule at Chester River Hospital to evaluate my condition and determine whether I should stay or go to another facility for more intense care. It was recommended I remain at Chester River for continued evaluation. Nurse Agnes provided constant monitoring. Dr. Lukas checked back every few minutes to make sure I was stable. The staff welcomed my husband and daughters who remained at my bedside.\nDr. Lukas said I would be transferred to a more acute-care facility and asked for my preference. They found me a bed in Easton hospital.\nBest Care Ambulance transported me to Easton promptly the next morning. The EMT who rode with me had extensive military and over 25 years professional EMT experience. Our driver was a retired Black Hawk helicopter pilot. I knew I was in great hands.\nThe nurses, doctors and staff at Easton Hospital were exceptional, highly skilled professionals with a pleasant, caring attitude.\nI was not a likely candidate for a stroke. I exercise regularly, eat right and have no pre-existing health conditions. Easton hospitalist Dr. Devkota and neurologist Valentin knew this and ordered extensive tests to find the cause of my stroke. They found I have a rare genetic blood disorder that causes blood clots, hence the stroke.\nTo all the naysayers and critics I say, acute care doesn't get better than the experience I just had. I often get asked by real estate buyers, \"How is your local health care\"? Now I have firsthand experience to tell them; it's excellent.\nThanks to all who helped with my care and recovery.\nCINDY GENTHER\nRock Hall \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — After months of controversy surrounding its creation, the St. Michaels Tourism Advisory Board held its first meeting at the Boy Scout Cabin in St. Michaels Thursday morning.During this meeting, members of the board, the St. Michaels Business Association and residents of the town came together to discuss the future and current condition of the tourism industry.\nThe board discussed potential budgets, marketing and branding strategies including combining various websites, and getting a better understanding of the tourists who are visiting and the tourists the board would like to bring to St. Michaels.\nTimothy Law, the representative of retail businesses on the board, said as a business owner he is really excited for the work the board will produce.\n\"I love St. Michaels, and today was a huge stride forward to really understanding tourism and promoting our spectacular destination. I think it's a great group of people and we've got a great diversity of thought and diversity of background. It was just a very positive first step.\"\nThe idea of a tourism board was brought forth during a commissioners candidate forum hosted by the St. Michaels Business Association last April, when representatives of the Business Associations stated a need for marketing assistance due to a decrease in revenues within the last year.\nThe purpose of the board, according to a town memo, would be to assist the town in its efforts to encourage businesses to locate or remain in the town and to make recommendations to the commissioners. The board would also \"work closely with the Talbot County Tourism Board on a unified, regional marketing approach.\"\nThe board has seven members serving four-year terms, all appointed by the commissioners. Membership includes residents not associated with a business and representatives from the lodging, eating/drinking, retail or service, marinas, museums and nonprofit sectors.\nThe members of the board were elected by the Commissioners of St. Michaels and include:\nBrian Ball, managing director for the Wildset Hotel, to represent lodging.\nChris Agharabi, chief executive officer of Ava's Hospitality Group, to represent restaurants.\nKatie Blaha, advancement manager of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, to represent nonprofits/museums.\nMichael Morgan, owner and president of St. Michaels Marina LLC, to represent marinas.\nTimothy Law, owner of American Holiday Shop, to represent retail.\nCraig Bertolett, chief operating officer of COLUMBIA Technologies, and Michael McMillan, associate clinical professor of accounting at the University of Maryland, as two representatives for the residents of St. Michaels.\nIncluded in the board is St. Michaels Commissioner Katrina Whittington as acting representative for the commission.\nOn Thursday, the board discussed the importance of a unified marketing message and the potential benefits of public Wi-Fi for data collection. Board members emphasized the need for a clear target audience and suggested a short-term plan to focus on digital marketing.\nBall said it's important for people to understand how tourism effects all aspects of the town's economy.\n\"St. Michaels is very much a tourism-based economy and it really affects everything we do from local government to all the businesses and all the restaurants and hotels,\" Ball said. \"I think that this (board) is a very valuable economic tool to use to help the town grow.\"\nPlans were made for the next meeting to include presentations on budget allocation and marketing strategies. The next meeting will be held on Jan. 30. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Waterfowl Festival looks forward\n\n May 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 815\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Deena Kilmon, the new executive director of the Waterfowl Festival, is excited to bring fresh energy and invite a new generation into the mission of the organization.Some changes are already visible. The Waterfowl Festival has welcomed a new staff and opened a new gift shop at the Armory, which houses the festival organization.\n\"We are laying the foundation for the future. If you think you know the Waterfowl Festival, I bet you don't. I invite people to come down to learn not only about the work we have done, but the work we want to do,\" Kilmon said.\nFor three days every November, about 20,000 visitors come to Easton for the annual Waterfowl Festival, which features art sales, demonstrations, educational events and more.\nBut the Waterfowl Festival is a year-round effort, with the organization also hosting a variety of events and supporting conservation nonprofits.\nMore new developments can be expected soon, Kilmon said, some of which are with the Armory building itself.\nOne of the big ways she wants to begin a new era for the Waterfowl Festival is by revitalizing the Armory's massive space.\nThere is a walled off stage at one end, and Kilmon wants to bring the proscenium arch back into use.\nThere are also rows of historically accurate new windows that will surround the Armory's drill space. They give the whole auditorium a kind of face lift.\n\"These are what the Maryland Historical Trust paid for. So it looks the same on the outside as it did to the 97-year-old building. We have just applied to the county to fix the roof. Once we fix the roof, the vision is to fix the stage,\" Kilmon said.\nKilmon's Assistant Director Sammie Mooney, who has a background in professional and community theater, wants to invite a whole new generation of the community into the building and maybe even rent it out.\nMooney is excited to connect with younger members of the waterfowl festival scene.\n\"I don't think I am trying to develop anything brand new, but bringing in newer people, the younger generation for the longevity of the festival,\" she said. \"We want to do so many things with the building because it kind of sat here. It is an amazing building. We want it to become kind of a community center where events are always going on.\"\nOne such event is inviting in photographer Kristin Rutkowski, who created the portrait project \"Her Helm\" of women captains who ply the waters of the Chesapeake.\n\"It is all about the water and literally fits right in our mission,\" Kilmon said. \"She will be here June 7, and I have another guy who wrote a book about raptors. He should be here in July. That is the kind of stuff we are bringing in. We could show a film here.\"\nOrganizers' passion to attract people to the Waterfowl Festivals' activities comes from the festival's mission and from the land itself.\n\"I love the Eastern Shore, the culture. When I was 14, I read James Michener's \"Chesapeake\" and totally fell in love with the romantic version of the Chesapeake Bay,\" Kilmon said.\nShe said her whole family loves to get out on the water and enjoy the open spaces.\n\"At the festival that is what we do. Try and conserve those spaces and make them available to and accessible to everyone,\" Kilmon said.\nThe organization does this through more than just hosting the annual festival and hosting events. The Waterfowl Festival has also invested millions of dollars into conservation efforts.\n\"We support organizations that do that work. There have been three or four dozen organizations over the years. It is well over $5 million since 1971,\" Kilmon said.\nTheir latest gift was to the Wellington WMA in Somerset County. They are taking farmland and turning it back into wetlands, partnering with private donors, the state and Ducks Unlimited.\nKilmon mentioned that there is a grant program for conservation organizations.\n\"It is a mini grant program for up to $5,000, and we are awarding about five of those. Say you are a little organization with conservation and education and there is no other funding for a project they want to do. We have already set this money aside at the Mid-Shore Community Foundation,\" she said.\nShe invited interested individuals and organizations to go to the Waterfowl Festival website to find a 30-minute application to receive a grant.\nBecoming the new executive director has widened her eyes as to what the festival has done, Kilmon said.\n\"The legacy is insane. People have forgotten some of the players have passed or moved away, but some of their children are still here. What we are doing now becomes even more critical to this generation. They thought it was a crisis in '71, but what is it like now? It is beyond a crisis,\" she said.\n\"What I think is critical is re-engaging with our community and bringing in a new generation to make sure that the legacy of the festival continues,\" Kilmon said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In today's deal, a defender fooled declarer by dropping an unnecessarily high card. However, it helped that he had calculated his \"generosity\" couldn't cost a trick.\nIn four hearts, declarer won the first trick with his club ace and cashed the heart ace, \"dropping\" West's queen.\nWorried that East had four trumps, South immediately ran the diamond 10. East kept up the good defense, ducking his king. Suddenly fooled, South repeated the diamond finesse, but East won with the king and gave his partner a diamond ruff.\nWest cashed the club queen, and the heart jack was the fourth defensive trick.\nCool - but how did West know he could afford to play the heart queen? Well, if South had started with A-Jx-x of hearts, he would have played a heart to dummy's king and taken the trump finesse. So, when South started with the heart ace, East was marked with the jack. Dropping the queen was safe. Also, it couldn't mislead East, because South was marked with four hearts from the auction. (If South had opened one no-trump with five hearts, he would have drawn two rounds of trumps before taking the diamond finesse.)\nHowever, remember, when trying a deceptive defense, be careful not to deceive your partner more than declarer. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This means a resident would not be able to vote in Oxford town elections if they aren't registered with the county board.\nBefore the vote was taken, Bell expressed concern that if the resolution is not voted on at the meeting, it could be delayed to the point where, if the resolution is passed, it is not in effect for the town's upcoming election in June when Commissioner Tom Costigan's term is set to expire.\nBut Bell, who ultimately voted in favor of tabling the resolution, acknowledged the commissioners should not rush into making amendments to the charter regarding voting.\nAt a public hearing for the resolution Feb. 25, residents shared thoughts on who should and shouldn't be considered eligible to vote in town elections. The discussion, which opened the doors to potential additional charter amendments, led commissioners to hold a work session March 5.\nGreer said the work session brought a lot of input, and she said there were still a lot of questions.\n\"I do not want to pass this in a rush tonight,\" she said Tuesday.\nCostigan, the only commissioner to vote against tabling the resolution, said he felt the resolution addressed a \"flaw\" in the charter's verbiage.\n\"All that it did was recognize that the Talbot County system was the most logical way to assure that people are eligible and can vote,\" he said, adding that the concerns around who is eligible to vote would need to be addressed in another section of the charter.\nAfter the resolution was tabled, Town Attorney Lyndsey Ryan suggested the commissioners write rules for the Oxford Election Board regarding registration, absentee ballots and poll watching.\n\"The last election we had a livestream for individuals to watch,\" she said. \"If you're going to follow that process again, we should have something established.\"\nGreer said they should hold a work session on the matter, and Bell agreed that a work session should be scheduled. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Rabbi Hyman delivers multicultural understanding\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: News \n \n 705\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Easton has been and is blessed with an extraordinarily number of exceptionally talented individuals engaged in a wide range of community service endeavors.One of them is Rabbi Peter Hyman DD (Doctor of Divinity) who is retiring in October after serving 18 years as the first full-time rabbi at Easton's Temple B'nai Israel.\nRabbi Hyman has a long history in walking his talk on promoting greater understanding of and respect for individuals with different religious beliefs and different faith journeys.\nThere is no more enduring symbol of Rabbi Hyman's commitment to respect for other religious beliefs than a Persian rug he bought in Israel 40 years ago. It is now on display in his office. That rug includes 99 names of God in Arabic. Rabbi Hyman views it as a metaphorical bridge connecting people of different faiths.\nHe once asked the leaders of a mosque if they could help him translate some of the Arabic words on his rug. They did so, amazed that such an inclusive rug was owned and displayed by a rabbi.\nFor Rabbi Hyman, it was simply his belief that \"building relationships not only creates friendships, but they also cement ties.\"\nA partial list of his local efforts to improve the quality of life in our community and beyond, includes serving as a member, program vice president and president of the Talbot Association of Clergy and Laity. He received an Award of Appreciation for Outstanding and Inspiring Interfaith Work in Talbot County for a Temple B'nai Israel February Lecture Series: \"Introduction to Islam.\"\nHe was a recipient of the NAACP Dorothy Webb Black Community Service Legacy Award and a recipient of a Governor William Donald Schaefer Helping People Award. He was a member of The Frederick Douglass Celebration Committee and delivered the sermon at the Community Interfaith Worship Celebration, which was a part of the \"Douglass Returns\" statue dedication.\nAn author and teacher, he served as a presenter and instructor at Chesapeake College's Institute for Adult Learning and collaborated with Bishop Joel Marcus Johnson to launch a \"Downtown Lunch and Learn\" program. He was elected to the board of directors at the YMCA of the Chesapeake and appointed chair of the board at the Easton YMCA.\nSupport for Scouting has been a huge part of Rabbi Hyman's life since he earned his Eagle Scout award, as did his two sons. That is an achievement that has been earned by only 6% of all Scouts since 1912.\nHe has served as a scoutmaster and a chaplain at Scout World Jamborees in Thailand, England, Sweden and Japan and a National Jamboree in the United States. He was the first national chair for the Messengers of Peace Program, BSA, after having served as a national chair of the Jewish Committee on Scouting and as national Jewish chaplain — Boy Scouts of America. He was the keynote speaker at a national annual meeting of the BSA \"Duty to God Breakfast\" in Washington, D.C.\nHe is a recipient of the Silver Buffalo Award for distinguished service to youth awarded by the National Council of Boy Scouts of America. He is also a recipient of the Bronze Wolf Award, which is the Scouts' highest honor. It is presented by the World Scout Committee to recognize the service, commitment and contributions of volunteers to the Scout movement. Not surprisingly Hyman received the award for his interfaith activities and his lifelong commitment to \"building bridges between people and nations.\"\nRabbi Hyman represented the BSA in Saudi Arabia at Saudi Nation Day when they received an award for the work of the BSA with the Messengers of Peace Program. This program promotes service projects through social media in effort to achieve world peace.\nHyman recalls that trip as the most amazing experience of his life because he was welcome in a Muslim country.\nWhile the news of Rabbi Hyman's impending retirement is bittersweet, there is some good news.\nHe is not planning to leave the Eastern Shore.\nWhether he stays here for the short term or long term, one thing is certain. He has made countless selfless contributions to help make Easton, Talbot County, and our world a better place.\nEach one of them has earned Rabbi Hyman a well-deserved thank you and Godspeed.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant based in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The former would add to the district's multilingual and special education staff, while the latter aims to inch the district closer to state-mandated $60,000 teacher salary minimums by fiscal year 2027.\nDistrict leaders say it's a \"scaled-back\" request from its $5.7 million ask of the county earlier this budget cycle.\n\"We recognize the financial pressures you face,\" Board of Education President Emily Jackson said at a May 6 budget hearing. \"This ask is lean, deliberate and rooted in what's most necessary to keep moving forward.\"\nIn the county's budget already is $55 million for TCPS as required by The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the state's overarching education improvement framework.\nCouncil members are left to mull the best option as they prepare to vote on final amendments to the county's draft $161 million budget. So far, there's no clear decision.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher supported fulfilling the district's full $5.7 million request last month and maintained that stance for the pared down ask at a budget deliberation Tuesday.\n\"We're going to have to do it sooner or later,\" Lesher said. \"I think it makes sense to do it this year and reduce the pain next year.\"\nPresident Chuck Callahan said he feels comfortable with honoring the $600,000 part of the request to cover the new positions.\nCouncil members Keasha Haythe, Lynn Mielke and Dave Stepp have all indicated they need more time to consider options.\nAny additional funding granted would result in an education supplement to the property tax rate, which is 79 cents per $100 of assessed value.\nTalbot County is already mandated by the state to pay $440,000 for teachers' pensions, which will be collected through a supplement of less than half a cent per $100 of assessed value.\nThree potential scenarios for tax supplements have been laid out by county staff:\nTeachers' pensions only: 0.0045 per $100 of assessed value.\nTeachers' pensions and $500,000 for salary increases: 0.0096 per $100 of assessed value.\nTeachers' pensions and $600,000 for new positions: 0.0106 per $100 of assessed value.\nHaythe said Tuesday she's trying to balance helping the school system with preventing tax increases for residents on fixed income, such as seniors.\n\"I am in no way, shape or form trying to discount the great work that the school system does and what the teachers do in the classroom,\" Haythe said.\nAt last week's hearing, teachers and parents advocated for the council to include the $1.1 million. Lisa Hayes, a parent of three TCPS graduates, said past education investments are paying off now as her children enter the workforce.\n\"You cannot not fund a budget for our children's education because there is nothing more important than that,\" Hayes said.\nAndy Burke, president of the Talbot County Education Association, which functions as the teachers' union, made his case.\n\"We continue to see too many educators migrate away to the higher wages and salaries paid in neighboring public school systems,\" Burke said.\nIn an emailed statement, TCPS Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said the district made \"very difficult choices\" to reduce its request to the county.\nJones noted staff will present the Board of Education with a budget amendment package in June, which will adjust the $86 million unrestricted budget the board OK'd in February.\n\"We will eliminate most of the new positions we had requested,\" Jones wrote. \"We will scale back our requests and defer programs that will have the least direct impact on our goals for our students.\"\nA final decision by the county on the $1.1 million in question, as well as the entire FY26 budget, is expected at the council's May 27 meeting.\nWhile no clear choice was made during Tuesday's deliberations, county and district leaders did agree that state mandates and formulas are creating the tricky fiscal situation.\n\"It's just become screamingly clear that there's a disconnect at the state level between the requirements that they're putting on local schools across the state, and the funding formulas that are articulated to county governments to pay for their education,\" said County Manager Clay Stamp. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Some people have a fear of numbers like 13 and 666. What in the wor l ddoes anumberhavetodowith anything?Not being superstitious, there are times I am slightly confused about life. Something happens that I don't feel I'm in charge of.For example, the other morning, the gracious mistresslof the parsonage entered the living room, where I was sitting on myl easy chair drinking coffee. With alhuge smile, she said, \"I got you an apple fritter for this morning.\" And she gave it to me, smiled at me and then walked away.The following day, I got up and got my coffee, went out to my easy chair in the living room, and started to sip it very carefully.As I was getting situated, the gracious mistress of the parsonage walked in, and I saw in her hand another apple fritter.Again, I got up the following day, went and got my coffee, and sat in my easy chair. In a few mo me nts, in walks lthe grfccio Bs mistress of the parsonage, and in her hand is another apple fritter.\"Here's an apple fritter for you this morning. I think you'll enjoy it today.\" She smiled at me, turned around, and returned to the kitc hen.It's not that I can't handle an apple fritter because I can. It's the fact that someone is bringing these apple fritters to me who does not like apple fritters. Something is happening behind the scenes, and I'm anxious to find o ut.The next day, the same thing happened. Now I'm getting to be suspicious. What in the world am I missing here?Not wanting to sabotage my good luck the last four days, I kept silent and enjoyed the fritter. Whatever is behind this, I may never know, but I w ill enjoy it for whatever it is worth.I couldn't help thinking of a Bible verse, \"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not\" (Galatians 6:9).Sometimes, the best thing to do is NOTHING and let God have it.Dr. James L.

The national average price of diesel has declined 1.8 cents in the last week and stands at $3.472 per gallon.\nAccording to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $2.63 per gallon Sunday while the most expensive was $3.79 per gallon, a difference of $1.16 per gallon.\nThe falling prices may be coming to an end.\n\"As we edge closer to the end of the year, we're seeing momentum for falling gas prices weaken, which is typical as the national average generally bottoms out between Thanksgiving and Christmas,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"With oil prices rising back above $70 last week, gas prices may have less potential to drop much further, though there may be a second window of lower prices in January or February in some areas, but even that won't last long.\"\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 0.8 cents per gallon in the last week, averaging $2.98 per gallon today. The national average is down 7.5 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 7.1 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nDec. 16, 2023: $3.10 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.05 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2022: $3.18 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.13 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2021: $3.31 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.32 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2020: $2.34 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.20 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2019: $2.45 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.56 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2018: $2.33 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.36 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2017: $2.43 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.43 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2016: $2.28 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.23 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2015: $2.02 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.01 per gallon)Dec. 16, 2014: $2.63 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.51 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $2.84 per gallon, down 5.5 cents per gallon from last week's $2.90 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.15 per gallon, down 0.5 cents per gallon from last week's $3.16 per gallon.Hagerstown: $3.00 per gallon, down 6.1 cents per gallon from last week's $3.06 per gallon.\n\"While several states saw gas prices cycle last week, marked by a big jump in prices after a large decline, those that did see hefty jumps should see prices drift a bit lower, potentially making a second run at the season's lowest prices,\" De Haan said. \"The West Coast, including California, should continue to see prices drift lower, but with just a few weeks left in 2024, all attention turns to 2025.

    "content": "Kids show their skills at the Talbot County Fair\n\n July 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 649\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Fair celebrated its 41st annual event this week. Hundreds of residents came together to experience the various activities put together by organizers, volunteers and sponsors.The five-day celebration included events such as fashion shows, games, bouncy castles and vendors. Many of these events were hosted for young people with an interest in leadership, community service, arts and agriculture.\nThe opening ceremony was held on Thursday evening, kids held flags at the center of the Main Show Ring, Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) presented a citation of recognition to organizers of the fair and John Coleman, officer from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office, sang \"God Bless America.\"\nLinda Brown, host of the opening ceremony, said in the past, Talbot County had to share its fair with other counties because of how small the county was. Today, Brown is proud of the work that the community does to make the fair possible.\n\"The big thing about this fair is that our community comes together,\" Brown said. \"(I) couldn't count the volunteers that come and do their piece. It could be shavings in a cow barn so that we can have animals. It could be taking a leaf blower and blowing the leaves out of our pavilion. Everybody just jumps in and works together to put on this amazing fair.\"\nBrown said she is proud of the work done by children and young people across the county, which was on full display at the fair.\nThis included the work of her granddaughter Annette Clougherty, who brought three of her cows for show this year.\nClougherty, 12, said she has deep love for animals and hopes to one day become a veterinarian. Her cows, Reba, Andy and Dolly huddled near a giant fan to cool off from the hot weather.\nClougherty encourages any kid who has an interest in animals to raise the animal of their choice and bring them to a local fair.\n\"Do your research, learn and don't just chase your dreams so you can get the money and be done with it,\" she said. \"Actually get into it because these guys (her cows), I don't ever imagine them going to the market, they're always mine in my heart.\"\nClougherty is proud to announce that she is taking her cows to Queen Anne's Fair, which is a big step for her family.\nIn a different stall, Bailei Caldeira, a young pig farmer, brushed her two pigs before a showing. It is her second year showing her pigs, and she said she is better prepared to make an impression. Caldeira said she has always loved pigs.\nWhen asked what advice she would give to kids who would like to raise pigs, she said working hard is the key to caring for pigs.\n\"Don't be scared, just do it,\" Caldeira said. \"Don't care about anyone else. Just care about your pig and you.\"\nFollowing the animal showing, dozens of kids from all age groups showcased their self-created outfits during the Talbot County 4-H Fashion Show.\nThe 4-H program is a local club teaching kids new skills, such as sewing, photography and more. Each kid had a moment to shine as dozens of parents took photos and cheered for their stylish outfits.\nBrown, a former home economics teacher, said she was so proud of all the work that the young contestant did for this year's show. For her, as host of the fashion show, she is impressed by the 27 outfits being modeled in the show and the work of the volunteers who make the event possible.\n\"It's just a culmination of hundreds of people working together and everybody doing their part in order to come up with this little event,\" Brown said. \"We are not a big state fair. We don't have squeaky rides and all that. We're not big enough, but we have people in the community that just come out and enjoy, socialize, marvel at what the kids are doing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Dangerous minds - Israel-Hamas war, Musk comments, police surveillance spark new social media fights\n\n November 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; Apg National Enterprise Editor | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1895\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Holy Land war between Israel and Hamas is birthing increased police and government surveillance of social media, prompting calls for more Americans to report \"hate crimes\" and proposals to require all social media accounts to have public name verifications amid concerns about increases in antisemitism and terrorism threats.There are also pushes to deport some anti-war, pro-Palestinian foreign college students deemed supportive of U.S. designated terror groups and expel and ban Palestinian refugees from entering the country.The efforts are born out of security concerns stemming from U.S. support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 terror attacks. But they are also sparking concerns about stunting or intimating dissent, privacy and other free speech protections.There is also a new social media battle over Twitter/X owner Elon Musk's support for a social media post that talked about anti-white sentiments among \"Jewish communities.\" A number of major media and technology advertisers, who also compete with social media platforms and some of Musk's technology ventures, have paused advertising on X. That includes Disney (which owns ABC and ESPN), Apple, Paramount Global (which owns CBS and Comedy, IBM, Comcast/NBC Universal (which owns NBC and MSNBC) and Warner Bros/Discovery (which owns CNN).Musk said he agreed with a post from a Twitter who said \"Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them.\" \"You said the actual truth,\" Musk said in a reply Nov. 15, latter adding that his concurrence was geared toward progressive activist groups and the Anti-Defamation League.The Biden administration condemned Musk's statement Friday. \"We condemn this abhorrent promotion of antisemitic and racist hate in the strongest terms,\" the U.S. administration said in statement drawing parallels to the beliefs of the Robert Bowers, who faces the death penalty after the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh left 11 congregants dead.The ADL on Nov. 16 also criticized Musk. \"it is indisputably dangerous to use one's influence to validate and promote antisemitic theories, said ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblalt, who on Friday then praised Musk for his condemnation of pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas phrases 'from the river to the sea' and 'decolonization.' Musk said Saturday some of the critics are dangerously using the episode to squelch free speech and that. he plans on suing progressive activists he claims inaccurately showed neo-Nazi and antisemitic posts next to Twitter/X advertisers' promotions.\"I am sticking to my principles. As for any fake advocacy groups who seek to suppress free speech, they should remember that karma is real,\" Musk said on his social media platform.EXPELLING FOREIGN COLLEGE STUDENTSThere is a GOP push to expel foreign college students deemed to be supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and other groups on the U.S. government's list of terrorist groups.A group of 21 GOP attorneys general - including Ashley Moody of Florida and Austin Knudsen of Montana - want the federal government to \"vigorously renew vetting of foreign students' and deport those deemed to have endorsed or provided \"material support to foreign terrorist organizations.\" \"It is possible that renewed vetting of foreign students already admitted to the United States may reveal activity that renders them ineligible to hold a student visa and liable to deportation,\" Knudsen, Moody and their cohorts wrote in a letter Nov. 8 to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the U.S.Department of Education.Free speech and civil liberties advocates say the reactions to anti-Israel war protests (some of which have seen antisemitic rhetoric) can bleed into censorship as well as quieting and punishing voices of dissent.\"Free speech means protecting speech you don't like. Sometimes it even means protecting speech you find abhorrent and hateful,\" said U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, after voting against censure measure aimed at U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, over her anti-Israel rhetoric and use of a pro-Hamas slogan.BANNING PALESTINIAN REFUGEESA group of congressional Republicans - including U.S. Reps. Andy Thomas, who represents the Eastern Shore, along with U.S. Reps. Ryan Zinke of Montana and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and U.S. Sen. Steve Daines of Montana, are also leading efforts to keep Palestinian refugees from the war out of the U.S. Zinke, Harris and Greene also wants to kick out Palestinians who entered the country on or after Oct. 1 in the aftermath of the Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attacks inside Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.They say said he does not trust the Biden administration or Palestinian authorities to adequately screen potential refugees.Critics say the proposal is xenophobic.Similar sentiments related to refugees and college students have been echoed by 2024 GOP presidential candidates such as former president Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has suspended pro-Palestinian students' groups in his home state deemed extremist and favored restrictions on public library and school curricula content deemed inappropriate or offensive.While conservatives press universities, who have sometimes aggressively banned right-wing voices from their campuses, to condemn and crackdown on pro-Palestinian student protesters, the American Civil Liberties Union wants them to uphold free speech principles.\"It is precisely in times of heightened crisis and fear that university leaders must remain steadfast in their commitment to free speech, open debate, and peaceful dissent on campus.These principles are the bedrock of academic freedom at all universities,\" the ACLU said in a statement.\"The First Amendment protects all people who live in this country, whether they're here as citizens, foreign nationals, or visitors,\" the civil liberties group said.ENCOURAGING MORE HATE CRIME REPORTINGDaines and a bipartisan senators including U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, have also recently written to FBI Director Christopher Wray and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security asking for more investigative and enforcement resources to be dedicated to addressing antisemitism.The Anti-Defamation League reports a 300% increase in anti-Jewish threats, vandalism and violence since the start of the war, which has seen more than 1,400 Israelis and more than 11,000 Gazans killed.In a separate letter, U.S. Sen Jon Tester, D-Montana, also said FBI and DHS efforts should also be focused on white supremacists echoing past and current Biden administration efforts to go after alt-right groups.The Biden White House, which has put a focus on going after right-wing groups since taking office in 2021, has also launched a new task force to go after \"Islamophobia\" during the war.On Tuesday, the FBI said it added Oregon to a nationwide effort aimed at encouraging getting more Americans to report \"hate incidents' ' with billboards posted in Eugene, Medford and Corvallis as well as digital signs at Portland International Airport.Similar hate crime billboards have been put up across the country, including last month in North Carolina, along with ads on public transit systems, social media platforms and local media outlets.Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice and FBI released new data showing there was a 7.3% increase in reported hate crimes in 2022 (11,634 cases versus 10,840) in 2021.There were more than 6,500 racially motivated incidents - 52% of them aimed at Blacks - and more than 2,000 cases related to religion - with 55% targeting Jews, according to DOJ.SOCIAL MEDIA SURVEILLANCE, FORCED VERIFICATIONSA state law in Montana backed by Knudsen and GOP Gov.Greg Gianforte banning Chinese-owned social media app TikTok is also one of the central fronts in efforts to restrict social media platforms and content.Montana lawmakers worry about TikTok's data security and ties to the Chinese government.The ban is being mirrored in other states.The Montana prohibition is being challenged by TikTok and free speech advocates in court.But there are also other efforts to increase government regulations and scrutiny and law enforcement surveillance of social media.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Nov. 13 that state police have ramped up social media surveillance and will reach out more to individuals and groups posting hate speech online.\"We're very focused on the data we're collecting from surveillance efforts. What's being said on social media platforms.And we have launched an effort to be able to counter some of the negativity. and reach out to people when we see hate speech being spoken about on online platforms,\" Hochul said. \"Our media analysis, our social media analysis unit, has ramped up its monitoring of sites to catch incitement to violence; direct threats to others.\" The New York governor said the rise in extremist and violent threats after the start of the war in the Middle East \"poses a clear and present danger.\" But the idea of more aggressive police surveillance of social media posts raises some concerns.Gerard Kassar, chairman of the New York Conservative Party, said police social media monitoring is potentially \"chilling to the core\".\"Law enforcement authorities can and should monitor legitimate terrorism suspects online, but spying on everyday citizens is unconstitutional and wrong,\" Kassar said.Republican presidential candidate and former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador Nikki Haley wants to require all social media accounts be verified by name thus eliminating anonymous online speech on major platforms.\"Every person on social media should be verified by their name,\" said Haley, who is increasingly being promoted as an establishment and neoconservative 2024 alternative to former president Donald Trump.\"First of all, it's a national security threat. When you do that, all of a sudden people have to stand by what they say. And it gets rid of the Russian bots, the Iranian bots and the Chinese bots. And then you're going to get some civility when people know their name is next to what they say, and they know their pastor and their family members are going to see it,\" Haley told Fox News.Haley also backs a TikTok ban pointing to the recent viral traffic of a letter criticizing Israel and the U.S. from Osama Bin Laden.Harris told Fox News Nov. 16 that Congress could soon take some actions related to TikTok and the issue will come down to speech versus national security, citing the platform's Chinese ownership.The verification push sparked a backlash from free speech advocates, particularly on the right who have already been upset over social media bans and content restrictions over coronavirus vaccines and challenges to the 2020 election results.They say it will eliminate anonymous dissent and speech.\"Nikki Haley is 'openly' pushing for the government to use private tech companies to censor speech. This is a flagrant violation of the Constitution and straight out of the Democrats' playbook.Any politician who thinks it's OK for the government to use the private sector as its censorship bureau shouldn't be allowed anywhere near the White House,\" said Vivek Ramaswamy, who has frequently sparred with Haley over TikTok and other issues. \n \n Caption: ASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nTwitter/X, Tesla and SpaceX's CEO Elon Musk gestures during an in-conversation event with Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in London, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2023.\n \nASSOCIATED PRESS\n \nRepublican presidential candidates former U.N.

MICHAELS — Pioneers in Talbot County's advanced life support services gathered this week to reminisce on the 40-year anniversary of their revolutionary effort to improve emergency response on the Mid-Shore.Five Easton firefighters began volunteering to man a new advanced life support, or ALS, program on Aug. 13, 1985. They had just one vehicle from the fire department. They sacrificed time at home and kept up constant communication to ensure someone was ready to respond to a cardiac emergency at any given moment.\nThe \"first five,\" as they're often called, were Wayne Dyott, Kevin Knussman, Marc Stockley, Ray Taylor and the late Gary Jones.\nWednesday afternoon inside the Harrison's Harbour Lights restaurant in St. Michaels, the four men shared laughs and memories of the effort they spearheaded four decades ago to the day.\n\"It was quite a haul,\" Stockley recalled. \"And unfortunately, in the past five years, I've been able to use this (ALS) system several times. And seeing the changes. It's been interesting to see the advancements. The care level is always there.\"\nThey were joined by others integral to the early success and soon-to-come expansion of paramedic services in Talbot County: Margie Callahan, then-nurse coordinator at Easton Memorial Hospital, and Buddy Harrison IV, former County Council president and the first director of Talbot County Advanced Life Support.\nThey all took time to reflect on Jones' integral role in the effort.\nJones, former director of cardiovascular services at the Easton hospital, died in 2021. Dyott said Jones joined the fire company in the 1980s knowing the ALS program was about to kick off.\n\"Ultimately, he was a good bridge between hospital staff, them accepting us and bringing the whole program together,\" Stockley said.\n'SKEPTICISM AT FIRST'\nJones and others worked to show people the importance of pre-hospital cardiac care and why countywide ALS services were needed.\nA half-decade ago, response times for heart emergencies could sometimes be 20 to 30 minutes. First responders typically reported to the fire station, then traveled to the location of the emergency.\nTaylor said it was hard at first for fire companies to even accept EMTs back in the 1970s. The five men, certified as cardiac rescue technicians, aimed to change that.\n\"We kept hearing the same thing: 'you're not doctors, you don't need to play doctor on the ambulance,'\" Taylor said.\nFire department and hospital leaders eventually warmed up to the ALS program, Taylor said. It didn't come without questions from the community, Stockley noted.\n\"I think there was skepticism at first, but I think it came around eventually when they started seeing positive results,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, Taylor recalled what may have been the first of those positive outcomes. In 1985, he and Dyott rode in the ALS vehicle to the scene of an overturned truck and a man lying down. Taylor successfully defibrillated the man, and that began to turn heads in the right direction.\n\"It's a good feeling,\" Taylor recalled.\nIMPACT FELT TODAY\nSince 1985, the modest five-person, volunteer venture in Easton has transformed to a countywide staple. The Talbot County Department of Emergency Services operates six ALS units and one \"chase vehicle\" for rapid response. Over 50 paramedics and EMTs staff the units, some full-time and others volunteers.\nThe hard work of the original five was done with the hope of having a comprehensive system like the one that exists today, Dyott said.\n\"That's what we started. That was our goal, our ambition,\" he said.\nTina Kintop, Talbot's EMS division chief, said the division's current success and bandwidth wouldn't be possible without those pioneers. Crews responded to around 6,800 calls last year, she noted.\n\"We are better prepared and educated more than ever in the life-saving business,\" Kintop wrote. \"Thank you to the visionaries 40 years ago and to those advancing ahead today.\"\nCallahan similarly credits the first five for persevering through the doubts and paramedic funding struggles in 1985 and the years after.\n\"They were a part of seeing this all come to fruition,\" she said.\nOver the last 40 years, it has always been about saving lives, said Talbot County's original ALS leaders. Knussman said all the vehicle swaps and early morning phone calls were well worth it.\n\"I think all of us would agree that the people on the street today are better trained, better educated, better equipped and better organized,\" Knussman said. \"That's something that all four of us, and Gary if he were here, that's something to be proud of.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dobson grew up around the fire house, always knowing he wanted to be a firefighter.In his teenage years, Dobson joined the Trappe Volunteer Fire Company as a junior cadet, and by 16 he began riding the fire trucks. He fondly recalls the \"everybody knew everybody\" aspect of the tight-knit community.\nDobson eventually moved to Easton, beginning his journey with the Easton Volunteer Fire Department in 2003. Over time, he's served in a number of roles, including most recently, assistant chief.\nNow he's taking on the department's top role for the first time. Dobson was elected the department's chief in December.\nWith a wife and two daughters, timing was everything for Dobson when considering the commitment to assume a role as demanding as Easton fire chief. The timing is right, he said, and he's looking forward to leading and making a difference.\n\"There's a lot of tradition here,\" Dobson said. \"It's certainly the biggest department in the county. It's got probably the most going on out of all the departments in the county. I think just being here, seeing how this department operates versus a small department. It's a business. And we're all here for free, none of us get paid.\"\nDobson officially began as chief this month. Sonny Jones just wrapped up his third two-year term leading the department.\nDobson, who volunteers at the fire department as all the firefighters do, is a patrol and operations commander at the Talbot County Sheriff's Office. He believes his experience leading around 35 deputies across multiple divisions will translate to his duties in the fire house.\n\"I think that I bring a lot of management skills, leadership skills,\" Dobson said. \"Just from my experience there, I think it helps you here.\"\nThus far, Dobson says the support he's received has been \"overwhelming.\"\nPast fire chiefs have reached out, and he hopes to pick up one thing from each of them to set himself up for success. For instance, Jones' ability as an incident commander is something Dobson admires.\n\"If there were ever a bad day anybody was having, he's who you would want there,\" Dobson said of Jones. \"Just the way he kind of rolls through an incident scene. He's been there and done that kind of thing.\"\nSimilarly, Jones — who is remaining involved with the department — spoke highly of Dobson.\n\"I've known J.R. the entire time that I've been a member of the Easton fire department,\" Jones said. \"J.R. is a first-rate guy. He's a terrific leader. He has many, many qualities which will bode well for him as the chief of the department.\"\nSome of the ongoing projects the new fire chief has his eye on include purchasing a utility vehicle to use for Rails to Trails and woods fires, buying a new engine and updating box alarm assignments. He also wants to implement some new standard operating procedures.\nDobson said he hopes to nail down a handful of tasks for the year and keep circling back to see what progress is being made. At the top of his list is recruitment and retention of volunteers.\n\"I think it all starts with recruiting. I think it all starts with retention,\" Dobson said. \"Those are things that we've done well in the past, although the last year or so we haven't gotten as many members as we would like. And sometimes we'll get members in and they don't realize the commitment.\"\nWhile acknowledging the town's consistent support of the department over the years, Dobson believes Easton Fire can do better in attracting more volunteers amid struggles statewide and nationwide to fill volunteer fire departments.\n\"We got to get people in here,\" Dobson said. \"We've got to get these trucks out. And I think that the way the town's growing, if we don't grow with it, then we're failing ourselves.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Tunis Mills bridge replacement project moves forward\n\n January 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 629\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TUNIS MILLS — A beloved bridge in the Tunis Mills community is moving toward reconstruction after months of resident input into the bridge's redesign.In recent years, the 345-foot-long Leeds Creeks Bridge and its wood planks have deteriorated. County engineers consider the bridge structurally deficient, necessitating a replacement.\nTuesday, the Talbot County Council agreed to move forward with the bridge replacement project. County Engineer Ray Clarke recommended the county work toward finalizing rights-of-way acquisitions and necessary permits so construction can be pursued later this year.\nAs proposed, the replacement would include a wooden deck and a timber wearing surface. The structures below the bridge supporting it, known as piles, would consist of concrete and steel materials.\nClarke told council members that in order to use federal funding for the project, the bridge replacement project cannot use timber piles per the State Highway Administration. He added that trying to build an all-timber replacement will cause significant delays and costs.\n\"The big disadvantage we have is that if we don't get the federal aid, we're probably going to need to request the council for additional funding for the project, local funding,\" Clarke said. \" … This could be a $3 or $4 million ask.\"\nThe project costs around $6.5 million, with $1.5 million coming from the county. The rest is federally funded.\nAdvocates of a 100% wooden replacement have been in dialogue with the county, including at an August public meeting. Susan McDermott and John Tabori, two of those advocates, have lived in Tunis Mills next to the bridge for four years.\nMcDermott says the original proposal to rebuild the bridge many years ago \"was just unacceptable to the community.\" The county's recent proposal matches more of what she and some other neighbors had hoped for.\n\"We're very pleased that the council has shown as much flexibility toward community views as it has,\" McDermott said.\nResidents like McDermott previously expressed concerns that an asphalt wearing surface would encourage speeding across the bridge. The county's plans now include a timber wearing surface. Clarke said that change will amount to around a $250,000 increase.\nThe other main change based on community feedback is a reduction in the height of the safety railing from 42 to 36 inches.\nMcDermott, who leads a small group of neighbors called the Tunis Mills All-Timber Bridge Alliance, hopes to find answers to whether an exception can be made for the requirement that piles not be timber.\nShe adds that the bridge is an integral part of the community.\n\"I think the town feels that the wooden bridge of Tunis Mills — one of the last wooden-deck bridges in the county — is very much part of the community,\" McDermott said. \"It's not just a bridge that occasional traffic goes across. We've got a lot of walkers in this neighborhood, a lot of kids and people just use that bridge as a foot path.\"\nAfter a video of the bridge was shown during the meeting, Talbot County Council Member Lynn Mielke said it seems the replacement \"needs to be done sooner rather than later.\"\nTalbot County Council Vice President Pete Lesher thanked Clarke and his team for their efforts to advance the replacement project.\n\"I appreciate the homework that you've done to investigate the alternatives as requested and appreciate that we really can't sacrifice the federal aid,\" Lesher said. \"The economics of this project dictate that we absolutely need to go with the recommended steel concrete pilings and concrete cap.\"\nLesher motioned to approve the project as presented, and the rest of the council unanimously agreed. Lesher added that he hopes the federal funding for the project comes through, referencing President Donald Trump's temporary pause on federal grants and loans announced earlier this week and rescinded Wednesday.\n\"And we'll just hope that any suspension of federal grant aid for transportation projects is very short-lived,\" Lesher said Tuesday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland House and Garden tour lets visitors explore Talbot County properties\n\n May 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 660\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Standing in the foyer of Canterbury Manor in Easton, one's eyes might dart straight out the window to the luscious green grounds that look out onto Trippe Creek.Or their eyes might be drawn to the estate's light and airy living room, which boasts a Steinway Piano from the 1920s, English furniture, and French and Dutch paintings. But no matter where the eye goes first, it's undeniable that it won't take long to feel drawn into the 1906 colonial revival style home.\nFor Easton resident Summer Parrish, it was the design of the kitchen — complete with French copper pots hanging above a big kitchen island — and the large but cozy-feeling butler's pantry.\n\"Oh my gosh,\" she said, talking about various parts of the house. \"The flower arrangements that are in (the) sun porch and on the kitchen table are the most beautiful I've every seen in my entire life.\"\nCanterbury Manor was the second home Parrish and her family members, including her sister and mother, toured on the Saturday of Mother's Day weekend. The Talbot County tour is part of the Maryland House and Garden Pilgrimage, which was started in 1937. Proceeds go toward the preservation and restoration of historically significant properties in the state.\nParrish's mother, Hope Leuchter, said comparing the first home they visited — a 1928 two-and-a-half story central brick mansion called Ellenborough — to Canterbury Manor is like comparing apples and oranges.\n\"The first one has the most magnificent trees,\" Leuchter said. \"And if you're crazy for trees and their botanical names and love their lore, that would have been it. Here (at Canterbury Manor), the artistry, the effectiveness of colors and choices. The home is beyond words beautiful.\"\nEvery two years, the pilgrimage brings Marylanders from all over the state to ooh and aah at historic architecture, grand gardens and fragrant floral arrangements in Talbot County. Most of the flowers in the arrangements are from the gardens of Talbot County Garden Club members.\nThe money raised from the Talbot County tour \"by and large\" stays in the county, Talbot tour co-chair Kim Eckert said. This year, the Talbot County Garden Club, which organizes the tour, chose to put proceeds toward Scotts United Methodist Church and St. Paul's Episcopal Church, both in Trappe.\n\"We wanted to focus on houses in Trappe, and we thought the best thing to do was to put the money back into Trappe,\" Eckert said.\nThe funds raised from the tour will go toward fully fixing and preserving both of the more than 250-year-old churches. Eckert said Lane Engineering and McHale Landscape Design both donated or discounted services to help make this possible. She said the Garden Club will even have some money left over to put toward other projects, such as the Talbot Historical Society gardens.\nAlong with Canterbury Manor and Ellenborough, tour-goers also had the opportunity to visit Easton's 219 S. Hanson St. and Trappe's Chloras Point Farm, Ferry Farm House, Trappe Landing Farm and Lloyds Landing.\n\"You get a really neat collection of Talbot County's homes, from the grand estates to the regular, beautiful farm homes,\" said Jack Thompson, executive director of the Maryland House and Garden Pilgrimage.\nAt Lloyds Landing, an 18th century house on the Choptank River in Trappe, Sherwood resident Kevin Carnahan took in the history of the property. The house, erected between 1720 and 1730, is one of the only eight remaining structures from that era in the county.\n\"They all have a lot of history,\" Carnahan said about the four homes he had visited so far. \"But this one in particular.\"\nMontgomery County resident Lynn Konefal talked about the pieces of history in the house, like the old family photos hanging on the walls.\nAnd even though it's one of the oldest structures in the county, Lloyds Landing was built with air conditioning and heat in mind, Eckert said.\n\"Based on how the roof is pitched and how it's located to the Choptank,\" she said. \"It's mind-boggling to me that they designed all that in 1729.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He welcomed all attendees, recognizing them for joining the festival and supporting conservation efforts.\nIn his speech, Milhollan shared his long history with the festival. Beginning with volunteering with his father and later becoming involved with his own family as an adult, Milhollan shared his pride for the countless families who have long-standing traditions of volunteering for the festival.\n\"I'm proud to have my oldest son cheering for the second year. He's joined by his two brothers and sister, all coming home from college to help for the weekend at the festival that's been part of my life and my family's life,\" Milhollan said. \"I believe in the crowd and see that many who have similar stories in passing the tradition of the festival to their families. This is what allows us to celebrate 53 years.\"\nThroughout the evening, several people were honored, including a memoriam for Kim Perry Whiteley and Hall of Fame presentations for Blenda Armistead, Ron Flohr and Butch Townsend. A waterfowl statue was unveiled by this year's Waterfowl Festival Featured Artist Ronnie Wells.\nAs Cook held the opening gavel in her hand, she looked to the leaders of the Waterfowl Festival, and they all smiled.\n\"Are we ready? All right, we're ready. Let's go,\" Cook said before banging the duck-shaped gavel against the podium and officially opening the Waterfowl Festival's 53rd year of celebration. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That can also help bring more transparency to city halls, local law enforcement and school districts.\n\"The more information that we share with the public about what's happening in town, the better. We also have a live feed for all of our council, board and commission meetings. If residents aren't able to make it, they can always watch the recordings from our website,\" said Cook, mayor of Easton.\nBut social media also magnifies broader contemporary distrust of the media, government, politicians and other institutions. It can also bring rumor mills and coarse discourse.\n\"From a city perspective, we just wish people would pick up the phone and call us. We are constantly fighting the rumor mill,\" said Groves Lloyd, mayor of Lodi, Wisconsin (a small town near Madison).\nGroves Lloyd identifies herself as a \"progressive feminist\" and \"small town mayor\" on her X/Twitter account where she is no fan of former president Donald Trump. But the Wisconsin mayor said she's pulled back on her progressive posts, especially on Facebook, because of the atmosphere of social media.\nIn Montana, Nelson, the mayor of Belgrade (which has a population approaching 13,000 people), worries all the political tensions at the local level discourages candidates for office and shortens tenures for staff and officeholders. He avoids social media altogether.\n\"I'm not on Facebook. I'm not on social media,\" said Nelson. \"You can call me, or if you need me, you can text me. That's my technology.\"\nFor a more expansive look at the issue check out our story online and in our national e-edition on Monday, March 11. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We are in our mid 70s and since our childhood we have always vacationed on the Eastern Shore. Twenty years ago we relocated to Northeast, Tennessee, but still annually come back to the Eastern Shore to get our \"seafood and steamed crab fix.\" However, I am writing to you not about your delicious food but about the kindness shown to us by Brent Spurry, owner of the Spurry Tire Company.Our story: We had just finished four glorious days in St. Michaels and while gassing up the car for the 450-mile return trip home, I noticed the valence (or mud guard) located under my front bumper was hanging down. Concerned that it would completely break away while on the highway, I began looking for a repair shop. It was Saturday, and I learned many repair shops were closed. In desperation I asked a kindly person tending our hotel's lawn for help. He directed me to the Spurry Tire Company on Elliot Road. He said be sure to ask for the owner, Brent Spurry.After a 20-minute ride including through picturesque downtown Easton, I arrived at the Spurry Tire Company. It was a larger business than I anticipated with six bays (all full) and maybe a dozen employees (all very busy). The waiting room was also full of customers which I thought didn't bode well for an out-of-state vehicle with a hanging mud-guard being repaired anytime soon.I reluctantly asked to see Brent Spurry and to my surprise he appeared within a minute. I related my story, and he said his bays were full but when one became available someone would take a look. I walked outside to ponder my next move (should I risk the trip home).Just then I heard a pleasant voice say \"We are putting your car in an open bay.Ten minutes later same voice says \"all fixed you're good to go.\" Surprised and grateful I asked, \"What do I owe you?\"[[---]] see the office was the reply. I return to the waiting room (it was even more crowded).\"Hello, I'm Mr. Townsend, you folks were kind to fix my car, what do I owe you?\" Nothing was the reply from the counter clerk. I said obviously this is a busy place but can I see Mr. Spurry?Within minutes Brent Spurry appeared. I thanked him and politely insisted that I pay him for the work.He smiled and said, \"No charge\" [[---]] even though I'm from out-of-state and he will likely never see me again [[---]] He said, \"No charge.\" In a flash he returned to the shop. I turned to leave and said to the crowded waiting room that they were fortunate to have a Spurry Tire Company in their city.A lady remarked for all to hear \"we know.\" I wrote this letter because I wanted others to know about Brent Spurry and his kindness and business practices.He is a perfect example of practicing excellent customer service even to someone from out-of-state.JERRY AND PEGGY TOWNSENDNortheast, Tennessee \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Time for DeSantis to rock and roll with Trump - COMMENTARY\n\n August 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A6 | Section: Opinions \n \n 564\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It's certainly about time for Ron DeSantis, who remains the main challenger to front-runner Donald Trump, to stop pulling his punches.On the campaign trail this week, responding to the latest indictment, DeSantis came closer than usual. In answer to a reporter's question, he actually acknowledged, \"All those theories that were put out did not prove to be true.\" In other words, they were false.In other words, the election was not stolen.How long will it take for him to come right out and say that?.And if the election wasn't stolen, what does that say about the effort to overturn it?.Storming the Capitol to overturn an election that wasn't stolen? What do you say about that? Based on \"theories that were put out (that) did not prove to be true.\" What is striking about DeSantis' move, however modest, is that it came on the same day as a new poll showing the race in Iowa to be closer than the nationwide contest, with DeSantis running second at 20% to Trump's 44%, still a double-digit lead but less commanding than in the national polls, where Trump enjoys majority support.This is according to the New York Times/Siena College poll of likely Iowa caucus participants. It suggests that DeSantis' efforts in Iowa are having at least some impact.Will he be willing to take on Trump's \"theories\" that did not \"prove to be true\" in the days ahead and actually hold him responsible for spreading lies?.And will that help him or hurt him with the voters, some of whom are currently leaning toward Trump, who he needs to persuade to win the Iowa caucus?.Obviously, from the care and the baby steps he has been taking, it is a difficult strategic dance for the Florida governor. He needs to win the support of Trump backers without losing his credibility entirely in the process.Of course the election was not stolen. Of course the claims of fraud were not true. The fact that we are even playing these games is a bit ridiculous in and of itself.But this is the dance for the nomination. Does it escape mention that Chris Christie, who has been the most outspoken of the Republican candidates in his criticism of Trump, does not break 1% in the Iowa poll?.One point to note from that survey: 67% of Iowa Republicans, when offered a choice, said they preferred a candidate who was focused on \"restoring law and order in our streets and at the border\" than one trained \"on defeating radical 'woke' ideology in our schools, media and culture,\" which sounds like Trump over DeSantis - or, rather, it sounds like Iowa isn't necessarily buying what DeSantis has been trying to sell.Which raises again the question of what he should be selling: likeability, for certain; electability, for certain; and maybe, as the key component to both of those, traits of character and integrity that used to be the stuff of presidential campaigns, what contests were said to be all about, the measure of the man - exactly the sort of measure that Donald Trump seeks to evade at all costs.When it comes right down to it, the question about election fraud is a question about integrity, and there is only one answer. The answer is integrity, and that is, ultimately, what DeSantis needs to demonstrate, and what he needs to sell. \n \n Caption: SUSAN ESTRICH \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Tourists flocked with their dogs to get a look at the creative process.\nNeil Hughes, an artists from Medford, New Jersey, said he prefers having more time to work on his paintings but that \"it's a great event, hard not to have fun.\"\nKaitlyn Hay an artist form Washington, D.C., said the event gave her the opportunity to appreciate work by many of the event's talented participants. \"The quick draw is so fun. You just get into the zone. I am certainly nowhere near the level of some of these fellow painters, but it is just fun to participate.\"\nOne of the youngest painters at the event was 7-year-old Isabel Tilley. \"I have been painting basically all my life,\" she said. \"I painted a cream-colored fence. I am inspired by art.\"\nNot only were there a lot of easels and paints moving around downtown, but there were art lovers waiting to find pieces that spoke to them.\n\"I have come for probably 15 years, and for 10 of those years, I have bought something,\" said Stephanie Saunders. \"I usually come to the Quick Draw and see what is around.\"\nNancy Tankersley, the judge of the Quick Draw event, cruised through the work with a clipboard, looking for the best.\nThere were many volunteers moving art, handing out water and keeping time.\nNancy Espenhorst, a volunteer, said, \"I have numerous jobs. I drive a golf cart. I sell art. I am at the information table, and I blow the horn. I like to stay active, and you get to see lots of people.\"\nThe event is organized by the Avalon Foundation.\nBill Witowski, the Avalon Foundation's chair, said art sales from the Quick Draw and other Plein Air events support the organization's efforts in the community yearound.\n\"Just look how many people have come out. It is just a magic time, and look at all the art sales,\" Witowski said. \"That really helps the foundation, which feeds back into the community.\"\nThe quick draw is an award-driven paint off. Up to $1,500 is in the offering.\n\"There are only nine awards so sorry to those of you who didn't make the final list. I really like a strong sense of place,\" Tankersley said.\nThe grand prize for the quick draw with an invitation to compete in Plein Air Easton 2025 was given to David Orrin Smith from Seattle.\n\"That format of paint something from life in two hours at the scale that I work in, which is 30x42 and watercolor, that is what I do all year long all the time,\" Smith said. He was grateful to all the volunteers who made the event happen. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

GoodLife identified the damaged section of pipe, which was removed and replaced the same evening. The system was returned to full operation shortly thereafter.\nAn estimated 500 gallons of untreated wastewater were discharged, with 1,500 gallons recovered during the response effort, the press release said. The affected yard area was cleaned using vacuum trucks, and lime was applied by the Talbot County collection crew to stabilize and disinfect the impacted ground surface.\nThe event was reported to the Maryland Department of the Environment and the Talbot County Office of Environmental Health.\nAccording to the press release, based on the location of the sewage discharge and the quick response, the discharge did not reach any navigable or shellfish harvesting waters. Environmental Health has determined there is minimal to no public health risk.\nIf the public has any questions regarding the public health determination, they may contact Brennan Greene, director of Environmental Health, at 410-770-6880. For questions regarding the discharge or the corrective action, contact Ray Clarke, county engineer, at 410-770-8170. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In fact, many people have complained to Sheriff Gamble since Maryland election law is being violated. As a good citizen and duly elected law enforcement officer, the sheriff wrote a letter to the election director questioning the intent of violating the law.For months, the election director has been dodging questions made by the public and apparently has been manipulating the law; however, this issue of flagrant abuse of the law has gone national. As anticipated, our Maryland state attorney general finally decided to weigh in. The Attorney General sent a letter to duly elected Sheriff reminding him that, as sheriff, he has nothing to do with enforcing election law.\nOf course, we citizens of all political parties have a responsibility to ensure fair and safe elections, and the sheriff, unlike the attorney general, was properly amplifying the disbelief of concerned citizens.\nIntentionally breaking the law? Are you really?\nAfter the slap, the attorney general quoted the law, which states each polling place shall have an equal number of election judges from Democrat and Republican parties. He then says that, although that is true at each polling place, the total number of judges need not be equal between the two parties. What? Where are these unequal judges on duty if not at a polling place?\nIn past years, the people of Talbot County were told by the director of the Board of Elections that there weren't enough Republicans who signed up to be election judges. Nonsense.\nIf judge totals must be equal at every polling place, then the totals across the county will be equal. There are now 61 Democrats, 53 Republicans and 10 \"other.\"\nIn our 10 precincts, only four abide by the law. It appears that information has been withheld from Talbot voters.\nWhat part of equal does the election director Tammy Stafford and the Talbot election board not understand?\nMARYANN JUDY\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "A map geek’s quest to clean the nation, 1 watershed at a time\n\n December 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Alisha Camacho Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 1411\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n By 11 a.m., Jon Merryman had collected 45 tires, 38 bags of trash, packs of shingles, a mattress, a playpen and remnants of an accident swept under a guardrail near College Park, Maryland.Merryman, 62, was frustrated and restless. The Nov. 6 election hadn't gone his way. A veteran and a man of action, he turned to a lifelong passion to cope: picking up trash.\nOver the following days, he cleaned up roadsides in 22 counties spanning Virginia and West Virginia.\n\"I call it channeling my anger,\" Merryman said, tone dropping.\nPhysical work helps him maintain his emotional and mental health. When he returned home to Catonsville, Merryman felt more rejuvenated and ready to face what came next. For him, cleaning up litter is a way to reclaim control, one piece of trash at a time, in a world that can feel overwhelming.\n\"I want people to feel like one person can make a difference,\" he said.\nMerryman traces his passion for protecting the environment to campaigns from his childhood. Campaigns like \"Smokey the Bear.\" \"Woodsy the Owl.\" The 1970s commercial \"Keep America Beautiful: The Crying Indian.\"\nWhile controversial today, the \"Keep America Beautiful\" ad had a simple message for 7-year-old Merryman: \"People start pollution. People can stop it.\" Inspired, he planned a post-Halloween mission to clean up wrappers and litter. With a full bucket, Merryman marched down to a storm drain, thinking that's where the trash should go.\n\"Thank God an adult was there,\" he said. The passerby explained how storm drains lead to rivers. He didn't know it yet, but Merryman would dedicate much of his adult life to rectifying this mistake.\nThe makings of a soldierMerryman's cousins, conservationists on Maryland's Eastern Shore, took him under their wings and ignited a passion for studying the environment. They invited him on bird banding and counting trips. Merryman remembers the sky filling with \"rivers of birds\" for 15 minutes at a time. Clicker in hand, he counted birds until his hand grew weary.\n\"You're witnessing the miracles of being on earth when you see stuff like that,\" Merryman said.\nHis cousins later dissuaded him from becoming a marine biologist.\n\"They got me geared up for this life of studying animals, then said, 'Oh, you don't want to do that. It's a life of chasing grants.'\"\nMerryman entered the University of Delaware as a biology major. Switched to geology. Jumped to civil engineering. His GPA plummeted. He pivoted to part-time status while working for the university. Eventually, he found his footing in geography while programming educational software. Also minored in photography.\nHis first summer out of college, Merryman worked as a volunteer ranger at the Grand Canyon, giving talks, leading groups and picking up trash in front of the visitor center. \"Funny thing is, that's what I love to do now: pick up trash.\"\nThe staff liked him and encouraged him to apply for a seasonal park ranger job, but then Congress slashed funding, so the job didn't exist.\nMerryman took on seasonal jobs. While working in the Everglades, he saw a billboard promoting the army's college fund.\nIt offered $20K for two years of service.\n\"Great option,\" he thought. He enlisted in the army and spent six years in the National Guard.\n'My wife puts up with a lot'When Merryman returned to civilian life, he worked in instructional technology. \"As it turns out, there's a lot of commonality between arranging the elements of a map and arranging the elements on a computer screen,\" he said.\nBut his passion for the environment remained. One day, while working at Lockheed Martin, Merryman came across a trash-strewn creek and park. He spent five years turning it into a sustainable habitat.\nHis hobby of picking up trash also found its way home. \"My driveway was full, I mean seriously, full of scrap metal,\" he said. He sold the metal from cleanups to fund his kids' robotics team. \"The things we do,\" Merryman chuckled.\nThrough it all, he said, it took a lot of patience from his wife, Kirsten. \"The spouses that put up with it are angels, too. They are. My wife puts up with a lot.\"\nTurns out, so do his kids.\nLitter everywhere in the middle of nowhere\nA common conundrum Merryman encounters is people acknowledging a problem but not taking responsibility. \"Someone else is doing the littering. It's those people,\" they think.\nMerryman became determined to show that littering is everyone's problem. During a road trip with his son to Los Angeles, an idea emerged, and they cleaned up trash in one county per state, adding two counties for Texas.\nWhen they arrived \"in the middle of nowhere\" in Turkey, Texas, Merryman found \"litter everywhere.\" He wanted people to realize that we are all responsible for this pile of trash because of all the things we buy and the resources we use.\nTo illustrate the extent of trash pollution, he started placing green dots on a map of counties he'd clean up.\n\"I'm a map geek,\" Merryman said. He had been tracking all the counties he visited for years, a hobby shared by fellow geographers. Now, he aims to pick up trash in every county for as long as possible.\nRecently, he picked his daughter up from school in Ithaca, New York. As they left Ithaca and crossed over into the Chesapeake Bay watershed, an idea \"dawned on me,\" he said.\nHe'd picked up trash in counties between Ithaca and Baltimore, having done this drive many times. \"I put those on the map,\" Merryman said when he realized he was nearly halfway done. \"I bet I could do them all\" in the watershed.\nHe now focuses on watersheds rather than state lines. Water carries pollution across borders, so \"state boundaries don't matter as much as the watershed,\" he said.\nOn Dec. 1, 2024, Merryman reached his goal. He picked up trash in all 206 counties in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Bringing his total count to 524. One-sixth of all counties in the United States.\nSharkey d'SharkOn February 2, 2022, at 2:22 p.m., Merryman retired — a moment he carefully planned. \"I walked out the door,\" said Merryman. \"I just thought it was funny.\"\nA few months later, Merryman found his retirement buddy, Sharkey d' Shark, on the side of the road. The abandoned toy-turned-sidekick became a playful way to engage others in cleanups.\nSharkey has a social media presence. \"It's a lot easier to have a back-and-forth conversation with Sharkey,\" Merryman said, \"as opposed to writing posts and getting crickets in response.\"\nMerryman hopes Sharkey can help educate and inspire younger generations to partake in cleanups. For now, \"about 90% of Sharky's fans are middle-aged women,\" he laughed.\nNature is innocentWhen not traveling to pick up trash, Merryman volunteers with Lights Out Baltimore, searching for dead or injured birds hit by windows due to disorienting artificial lights.\n\"Nature, as far as I'm concerned, is all innocent,\" Merryman said. Migrating birds navigate at night using the moon and stars, but lights lead them to windows. \"There's a reason it's happening. It's not because the bird's stupid,\" he said. The birds can't see the glass.\nNot long ago, Merryman found an old Facebook post when he first joined the group and held a bird for the first time in decades. Now, he's active in several Facebook groups where he educates others about window strikes. Sharing photos of the dead birds tends to upset people, especially those who have already seen them.\nOn the one hand, Merryman speaks to newcomers who aren't aware of this issue and spreads awareness \"over and over and over again.\" On the other hand, some people complain and don't want to see the photos.\n\"I'm sorry if it makes you feel squeamish,\" Merryman said, his tone serious. He paused. \"Actually, I'm not. I'm not sorry,\" he said with a wry laugh. \"I hope that it will make you care about it.\"\nIt is a difficult line to walk — getting people to care without turning them away. \"I'm just not good at drawing that line personally,\" he admitted.\nBut he is good at showing up and doing the dirty work. \"I'm happy to be the grunt, the foot soldier.\"\nMerryman has a plan for the rest of his retirement. He is going to pick up trash in every county in the United States. Until he physically can't anymore. Then he hopes to write a book.\nSo far, he's crossed off Arizona, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and New Jersey while nearing the finish line in Pennsylvania and Virginia.\nMaybe he won't reach his goal. \"But I'm gonna die trying.\" And maybe the world will be a little cleaner, with a few more birds in it. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Just play baseball the way they know how, and don't do too much.\"\nTalbot followed those instructions while riding the solid one-two pitching punch of Nathan Merchant and Couper Barletta on the way to a 5-2 title-clinching victory over Dorchester at Hog Neck.\nTalbot was scheduled to play Brunswick on Saturday in the first round of the state tournament in Berlin.\n\"It's a fantastic group of kids,\" said White, whose team won the best-of-three series 2-1. \"We're pulling them from three different high schools (Easton, St. Michaels, Saints Peter and Paul). But they jelled well. They've been accepting of, I don't want to say a diminished role. Let's say they were a shortstop at their school, but we're asking them to play left field. And everyone has bought into the team concept. Everyone has contributed.\"\nTalbot won the series opener 13-3 in Hurlock on June 24. Dorchester knotted the series at one-all the following night with a 14-7 win, setting up the decisive Game 3.\nDorchester took a 1-0 lead in the top of the first inning of the title game on Jackson Nehring's RBI single.\nBut Talbot responded with a four-run rally in the bottom of the first for a lead it never surrendered.\nBuel Jensen knocked in the tying run with a fielder's choice. Jace Elliott and Finley Carter each worked back-to-back bases-loaded walks to make it 3-1. Brody McDaniel, Talbot's No. 9 hitter, then laid down a two-out RBI bunt single to give Talbot a three-run lead after one complete.\nMerchant got the starting nod on the mound for Talbot and yielded two unearned runs and two hits over four innings, striking out two and walking three. Barletta came on in relief to seal the victory.\n\"It was very effective,\" White said of his team's pitching combination. \"Both guys. Different styles. Merchant gets a lot of weak contact, and then Barletta comes in and he's more of a strikeout, power pitcher.\nMcDaniel finished 2 for 3 with a pair of RBIs, and Elliott also drove in two runs. Talbot finished with 10 walks, with Ben White and Carter each drawing two. Jensen added two stolen bases.\nNehring, Dorchester's clean-up hitter, finished 2 for 3. Dorchester totaled seven stolen bases, led by Ryan Robinson, who had three.\nCarson Weber started on the mound for Dorchester, allowing four runs but no hits in 2/3 of an inning. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I've just got to meet it,\" she observes. \"Like, I'm bringing my whole life to this moment; it will surprise me, challenge me, show me where I was wrong, even make a fool out of me, but my job is to show up and not take adversity personally. Real happiness doesn't have to feel like Snoopy dancing with Woodstock; it can just be knowing you have the resilience to meet whatever comes to you. I will call that a good life.\"\nDar will be joined by special guest Heather Maloney, a Massachusetts-based singer songwriter whose voice is her \"not-so-secret weapon\" (Boston Globe) and whose \"lyrics cut to the chase\" (Huffington Post).\nMinor Gold\nWednesday, May 15\nDoors: 6:30 p.m.; Doors: 7 p.m.\nStoltz Listening Room\nMinor Gold are ARIA-nominated artists Tracy McNeil and Dan Parsons.

Dover Street, Easton, MD\nSouthside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes emerged from the New Jersey shore scene in 1974, and though they carried over a significant influence (and some key personnel) from Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band, the Jukes evolved as more of an R&B horn band in the Memphis Stax Records tradition.\nOrganized by singer John Lyon, guitarist/songwriter Steve Van Zandt (who decamped for the E Street Band in 1975, but continued to produce, manage, and write songs for the Jukes) and Richie Rosenberg, the band is well known for high-energy shows and no-holds-barred songs, including \"I Don't Wanna Go Home,\" \"Havin' a Party,\" \"The Fever,\" \"Talk to Me,\" \"Trapped Again,\" and \"This Time It's For Real.\"\nStill tinged with the exuberant rhythm and blues feel that is the Jukes' trademark, and loaded with the driving sound of the legendary Jukes horn section, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes continue to expound their signature Jersey Shore sound – all for the sheer joy of it. https://www.southsidejohnny.com/\nThe Brothers Comatose\nThursday, June 20\nDoors: 7:30 p.m.; Show: 8 p.m.\nAvalon Theatre\nWhether traveling to gigs on horseback or by tour bus, Americana mavens The Brothers Comatose forge their own path with raucous West Coast renderings of traditional bluegrass, country and rock 'n' roll music.

I love this stuff so much, I must admit to being slightly compulsive - gathering, testing and assessing techniques. Here are a few of my new favorites: BERRIESAre you familiar with that sick feeling that comes when you notice that the berries you bought yesterday are already showing signs of mold and turning brown? Here's the remedy: As soon as you bring them into the kitchen, prepare a mixture of one part vinegar (white or apple cider) and 10 parts water. Give the berries a bath in the mixture.Swirl them around a bit and then gently drain, rinse and place in the refrigerator.Don't worry. The solution is so weak, you will not taste the vinegar. This treatment should give your strawberries an additional two weeks of useful life and raspberries a week or more. Vinegar retards the growth of bacteria that causes berries to spoil so quickly.POTATOESTo keep potatoes from growing big ugly sprouts before you have time to use them up, store them with a couple of apples. For some reason, that really works to halt the sprouting.ALUMINUM FOILLet me just say that I'm a believer! It drives me crazy that I do not know why this works, but it certainly does: Wrap celery, broccoli and lettuce in a single layer of aluminum foil before storing in the refrigerator. Celery will stay crisp and fresh for up to a month stored this way. It's simply amazing.MUSHROOMSStore mushrooms in a paper bag. Now the air can circulate and the mushrooms will remain dry and lovely for weeks.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gluten-Free Bakery Girl rises to the challenge\n\n March 31, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Business \n \n 628\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — It began as a challenge for an already established cook.Tricia King, owner of Gluten-Free Bakery Girl, said that during her time as a personal chef, she had a client with rheumatoid arthritis who needed to avoid gluten in her diet. King undertook the task of creating tasty gluten-free recipes.\nNow, about 20 years later, she is the owner of Gluten-Free Bakery Girl, an entirely gluten-free bakery on the Eastern Shore.\nKing centers the health and well-being of her customers in everything she does, and that includes making sure all her baked goods are not only safe but also a delight to eat.\nThe passion for tasty food has been a long love of King's. She has been cooking almost all her life, and even when she wasn't cooking, she was studying and watching other cooks like Julia Child and her mother. She said that cooking just came naturally to her.\n\"When you have a passion for it, it's easy to do it,\" King said. \"I've loved food my whole life.\"\nAfter studying interior design, she decided to open a personal chef business in Salt Lake City, Utah, called Purple Pomegranate. For two years, she traveled from house to house every day, doing the shopping and cooking for two weeks and then repeating the same cycle with different clients.\nThen, she had the opportunity to be a sous chef in a hotel in Scotland.\nIt was there that she dove into baking. When she came back to the States, she trained under pastry chef Matt Ratliff in the Perry Cabin.\nThe work was intense, King said. Daily, the kitchen would produce 40 souffles, bake bread and cookies, and make wedding cakes.\nIn the back of her mind, she still yearned to open her dream bakery. So, she began using the back kitchen to try different gluten-free desserts.\nBefore she made the leap to establish her bakery, she shared her dream with one of her friends, and he said, \"Oh, it's never going to work. A gluten-free bakery?\" She smiles, recollecting the memory and how he has since taken back his words.\nGluten-Free Bakery Girl has been in business in St. Michaels for 12 years and will be opening in a bigger location in Easton. Its products can be found throughout Maryland, Delaware, D.C., Massachusetts, New York and other states nationwide.\nKing said the vast majority of her customers have celiac disease, an immune reaction to eating gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye. Due to this, it is of the utmost importance that there is no cross-contamination in her kitchen.\nShe operates in a 100% certified gluten-free facility and kitchen.\nAll products are individually wrapped to prevent any potential cross-contamination from other foods during shipping and sale, and all employees are only allowed to bring gluten-free food to work.\n\"People don't understand that you can't just bake in a kitchen and then wipe it down and then bake gluten-free,\" King said. \"Twenty parts per million, which is a crumb of bread, is enough to make someone who has celiac disease sick.\"\nMore than anything, King wants to help people with celiac disease lead a more accessible and safer day-to-day life. King said her customers with celiac disease often feel that they need to miss out on treats for their health, but having the opportunity to provide people the chance to indulge in a baked good makes all the effort she puts in her bakery worth it.\nKing urges young girls thinking of starting a bakery or any business to have faith in themselves and allow themselves to grow outside their comfort zones.\n\"We women are the hardest on ourselves,\" King said. \"We beat ourselves up the most. It puts blocks in front of us, but we have to know we can make it through. So, keep going. You have to keep going.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Rardin scores five goals in return as top-seeded Sabres grind way past Falcons for spot in MIAA B Conference championship\n\n May 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 881\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — It was the No. 1 seed.It had won 11 of its last 12 games, and had already twice beaten its opponent.\nBut none of that matter to Saints Peter and Paul High boys head lacrosse coach Todd Wolters after the first half of Tuesday's Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association B Conference semifinal.\nAfter mustering just one first-quarter goal and carrying a four-goal cushion into halftime, Wolters made clear to his team he wasn't happy.\n\"Coach pulled us over at halftime and told us that this could be the end of our season,\" sophomore face-off man Grant Messick said. \"'We could be done here.' But none of us want that. I think he kind of brought that out of us, just saying we could be going to Navy this Friday to win a championship that hasn't been done in a decade.\"\nThe Sabres responded, outscoring No. 4 Gerstell Academy by three goals in a decisive third quarter, catapulting them to a 13-8 victory on a dreary Tuesday afternoon.\nSts. Peter & Paul (15-4) advances to Friday's MIAA B Conference championship game where it will meet second-seed and two-time defending champion Archbishop Curley (11-7) at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium at 5 p.m. The Sabres defeated Curley twice during the regular season.\n\"They were taking a team lightly, like they've already won,\" said Wolters, whose team won 7-6 at Gerstell on April 12, then routed the Falcons 16-3 on their home turf April 30. \"And they've done that before. We just lose focus.\"\nIn his first game back from injury, JJ Rardin (five goals) gave the Sabres a 1-0 lead with 2:22 left in the first quarter, when he scored off an assist from Andrew Steinhardt.\nGerstell (6-10) tied the score on Bronson Peters' goal less than 2 minutes into the second quarter. Rardin gained possession out in front of the net and fired his second goal just under the crossbar to make it 2-1 just 18 seconds later. But the Falcons came right back with Ryan Ellis beating Sabres goalie Hank Wolters (11 saves) to make it 2-all.\nDavis Kimminau whipped a shot in from the right side, and less than two minutes later, set up Vincent Dyer's goal to nudge Sts. Peter & Paul to a 4-2 lead. But Peters (four goals) scored at the midway point of the second quarter to make it a one-goal game again.\n\"They came out and they didn't want their season to end,\" Messick said of Gerstell. \"They came out with nothing to lose. We're the one seed. They come out and they beat us, then it's a huge upset. And if they don't it's not what they were expected to do. So I think they had that mentality while we came out thinking, 'Well, we smoked them before. We're going to roll them this time.' But they didn't. They came out and they fought really hard.\"\nThe Sabres scored the last three goals of the half, as Liam Durnbaugh, Noah Zimmerman and Rardin each tallied to make it 7-3 at the break.\n\"Our guys were in it,\" Gerstell head coach Ryan Drenner said. \"We stayed in the fight the entire game. That was the biggest difference. We were here a couple weeks ago April 30. Very lopsided. We try to learn a lesson from every game regardless of the outcome of the game. And so for that one it was we had to come up with a better plan of how to travel down here and be ready to go from the jump. So we changed how we warm up just to be a little bit more alert from the start. I thought our guys did that today and we played four quarters of a great lacrosse game.\"\nGerstell cut its deficit to 7-4 just 19 seconds into the third quarter on a goal by Peters. Zimmerman scored for the Sabres, but Matthew Schols answered for the Falcons.\nSts. Peter & Paul took control the remainder of the quarter, getting one goal each from Steinhardt (four assists) and Kimminau, and two more from Rardin for a 12-5 lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\"We know how good we are,\" Wolters said. \"The third quarter we go and we really just started opening it up. And then in the fourth quarter we thought it was done.\"\nThe Sabres extended their lead to 13-5 before Gerstell scored the game's final three goals.\n\"We weren't hustling,\" Wolters said of certain stretches. \"We'd come down and throw it away and then they would go down and score on unsettled situations. They had eight goals and I know five to six were unsettled and we can't have that.\n\"It's a win. We'll take it,\" Wolters said. \"You can't win a championship unless you're in the championship. And we're in the championship.\"\nBASEBALL\nCOL. RICHARDSON 1, ST. MICHAELS 0\nAMERICAN CORNER — Jack Walls walked, advanced to second and third on a pair of low pitches, and raced home on a wild pitch in the third inning for what proved to be the only run Tuesday, as Colonel Richardson blanked the Saints to win the Class 1A East Region II final.\nColonel Richardson winning pitcher Daniel Hesson hurled a two-hitter. Connor Wheeler and Henry Mullikin each had a hit for the Saints.\nSt. Michaels pitcher Jacob Seek allowed one hit, that coming with two outs in the sixth inning when Hesson singled. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The open house celebrated the 75the anniversary of the Ladies Auxiliary, and there was a scavenger hunt for the Children.\nThere were reunions of friends new and old, many from first grade at Cordova Elementary School 50 and 60 years ago. Parents and grandparents showed their children their history with the pride.\nDespite the congenial atmosphere, there was a somber tone, with the passing of one of Cordova's own on March 2, Joseph Secrist Jr.\nWell known to all, he was a life member and former president and chief of the Cordova Volunteer Fireman's Association. He was also past president of the Talbot County Fireman's Association. Secrist was an instructor for the Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute for several years. He also served six years in the National Guard.\nCordova Day was hosted by the Cordova Historical Society. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Elmer Davis was outspoken Monday evening about bringing his constituents relief from the odors they smell during crab season.\n\"Constituents in the neighborhood should not have to go through another season of having to endure that kind of odor,\" Davis said. \"And if the business is friendly and working with the community, something of this nature should have been worked out prior to now.\"\nThe ordinance, which will go into effect later this month, requires that seafood processing operations install odor control technology \"in such a manner that no odor from any product or by-product can be detected outside the building on the same property or on adjacent properties or public rights-of-way.\"\nZach Smith, an attorney representing Chesapeake Brand Seafood, said the business' concerns center the spray application system it plans to install — which will cost around $20,000 and may not fulfill the town's new requirements of \"no odor\" being detectable.\n\"We're confident it will address the issue, at least to some extent,\" Smith said. \"But we're not confident, not necessarily confident, it'll meet that standard.\"\nSmith requested a compromise, stating he thinks the ordinance should not retroactively apply to \"existing, lawful seafood processing uses\" such as his client. He submitted proposed revisions to the ordinance that were read aloud Monday evening.\nFollowing a lengthy council discussion, Ward 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello said he was ready to pass the ordinance as written, without Smith's proposed changes. Council President Frank Gunsallus agreed those changes were \"overly specific.\"\nAbatiello made a motion to approve the ordinance, which was seconded by Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry. Gunsallus and Davis joined in voting yes. Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery was absent from Monday's meeting.\nTIMELINE DEBATEIn the approved ordinance, businesses must comply with odor control and storage requirements by July 1, 2025. Prior to Monday, the compliance date on the draft ordinance was Jan. 1, 2026. The change stirred discussion Monday evening.\nDavis pushed for that date to be even sooner — Jan. 1, 2025 — though he was outnumbered by Gunsallus, Abatiello, and Curry, who all voted in favor of amending the ordinance to the July date.\nCurry maintained that it's important the town be fair to the business since it's planning to pay up for the new odor control system to address the problem.\nTown Attorney Sharon VanEmburgh said she had legal concerns about shortening the period, saying that \"even January (2026)\" is pushing it.\n\"They've had time to comply,\" Davis said.\n\"But they didn't have this ordinance,\" VanEmburgh responded. \"The ordinance is what would be challenged.\"\n\"I mean the worst case scenario is that we go to court, and is that the end result? Then so be it,\" said Davis. \" … If you say comply by 2026, just think about this for a moment. The same people who live in Ward 4 have to suffer through this this year again until January 2026.\"\n\"I have to stand on what I believe in, and I believe that they've already had enough time to do it,\" Davis later stated. \"It seems to me that we're more worried about going to court than listening to the people. And I think we should listen to the people.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Along with the Delmarva Pride Center, the event was hosted by DoCo Pride and the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus.\nThe four-person panel — which included Del. Kris Fair (D-Frederick), Fair's Chief of Staff Camila Reynolds-Dominguez, FreeState Justice Executive Director Phillip Westry and Maryland Office of the Attorney General Civil Rights Division Chief Jonathan Smith — answered questions related to schools and workplace, health care and family law.\nCaleb Holland, an attorney and the chair of DoCo Pride, who moderated the town hall, said the goal of the event is \"to prepare, not scare.\"\nOn the topic of education, Smith said he expects the Trump administration will try to push through executive orders around funding schools that are based on sports issues, bathrooms or the ability to deadname or misgender students. But Smith said there are \"very significant responses\" states can make.\n\"There's been a body of law that's developed that says the United States government cannot, through its funding powers, coerce states to take policy decisions that are not for the function of funding,\" he said.\nWestry said organizing and getting active in politics, like school boards, is a good way to get involved.\nAlthough part of Wednesday night's conversation focused on bracing for what could happen in the country, the panelists also talked about what gives them hope.\nFair, who is the chair of the Maryland Legislative LGBTQ+ Caucus, recalled the 2018 midterm elections. He said the country elected more women, more queer people and more people of color than ever before.\n\"In 2018, we figured out that in order to protect our rights, we need to do everything we can to put as many people who look like us into positions of power,\" he said. \"What I am hopeful for is that 2026 looks just like that.\"\nReynolds-Dominguez, who was previously a policy advocate and legal impact coordinator at FreeState Justice, said that in the last couple of years, the state has taken an \"aggressive stance\" on doing everything possible to anticipate rollbacks. She said Maryland is \"situated to weather this storm\" and that should be used as a catalyst for doing long-term work.\n\"The core of all of this is shifting people's hearts and minds,\" she said. \"And if we're not doing that work, we're spending our time in the wrong place.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's a really good opportunity for us.\"\nIn 2024, Frederick hosted the inaugural Maryland Main Street Conference, which was a one-day event attended by more than 400 people.\nDay said in a press release the conference is an opportunity for economic developers to learn how best to invest in Maryland's historic centers.\n\"The Town of Easton is a prime example of the payoff of that investment, and I'm so excited to recognize them as the host of this year's conference,\" Day stated. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Trump, has been found \"guilty\" on 34 counts of what amounts to a misdemeanor under the usual circumstances. But since Trump is running for president of the United States, the circumstances are not usual, and so the law has been compromised in order to try to halt his campaign.\nA precedent has been set for political enemies to dig up frivolous charges against each other in order to take the other out of the running. This could result in chaos and the complete collapse of our system of government. Are politicians going to begin assassinating each other, as they do in other countries?\nI am reminded of Robert Bolt's play \"A Man for All Seasons\" about Sir Thomas More who refused to violate his conscience to please King Henry VIII. In a debate with his son-in-law, Thomas Roper, More claims that he would give even the devil the benefit of the law. Roper is appalled and wishes he could tear down every law which stood in the way of destroying the devil.\nMore responds thus: \"Oh? And when the last law was down, and the devil turned round on you — where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat?\"\nTwo hundred and fifty years later, one of our founders, John Adams, defended in a court of law several British soldiers who had shot his countrymen in what is known as the Boston Massacre. Adams was an expert on British common law and to him the defendants, whether he liked them or not, had the right to a fair trial; he made sure they had one.\nWhat is British common law? It began with the seventh century laws of the Angles and the Saxons who began to have hearings in which evidence was presented. In the late ninth century, Alfred the Great codified the laws of the Angles and the Saxons, insisting that rich and poor, high and low, were equally treated. In 1215, the Magna Carta stated the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, which is one of the foundations of our judiciary.\nWe have taken our legal system for granted. When some people who commit crimes go free while others are hounded for much lesser offenses, then the laws become meaningless. The people who hate Trump are willing to destroy our legal system in order to ruin him.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Woman charged for graffiti acts at Sts. Peter and Paul Elementary\n\n September 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 719\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A woman is being held at the Talbot County Detention Center after being accused of spray-painting graffiti around town, including at Sts. Peter and Paul Elementary School.Sian Radaskiewicz-King, 32, was arrested Friday by Easton police on charges of malicious destruction of property and use of a hate symbol. She was later charged with defacing religious property and disturbing school operations, among other counts.\nAccording to court documents, King allegedly spray-painted the transgender symbol on dumpsters, the sidewalk and a step outside the Catholic school off of Route 50. Other spray-painted symbols were found on a fence at the Hampton Inn next to the school, per court records.\nThe symbols were found elsewhere in town, including outside East End Liquors, The Market at Dover Station and other businesses. The transgender symbol, often used to encourage gender inclusivity, is a combination of the male and female signs.\nAt an unusually crowded bail hearing on Monday afternoon, Talbot County District Court Judge Karen Ketterman ordered King to be held without bond in the Detention Center. A trial is scheduled for Oct. 28.\nMany parents and school officials from Sts. Peter and Paul filled the courtroom. School Board Chair Peggy Wilson asked Ketterman to not approve King's release. Wilson cited the Aug. 27 shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis, which killed two children and injured 18 people, as a reason why the school community is concerned for the safety of students.\n\"Our fear is not the symbol itself, but the possibility of a copycat situation,\" Wilson said.\nKing, according to public legal representation, is transgender. She previously attended Sts. Peter and Paul School.\nThe Minneapolis shooter, Robin Westman, was referred to as transgender by federal officials. Westman's gender identity wasn't clear, according to The Associated Press.\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook said in a statement this weekend that the graffiti incidents are \"especially painful\" given the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting.\n\"It reminds us of the responsibility we all share to ensure our children's safety and well-being,\" Cook wrote. \"We condemn such acts of intimidation, they have no place in our community.\"\nIn a statement Sunday, the Delmarva Pride Center condemned the graffiti acts as a \"misuse\" of the international transgender symbol.\n\"We are deeply troubled that an LGBTQIA+ symbol was misused in a way that could be construed as hateful,\" the statement read. \"Symbols such as the Transgender Symbol exist to affirm identity, celebrate diversity, and foster belonging — not to spread fear or division.\n\"This incident occurs at a time when Transgender people continue to face targeted attacks in society. We call on our neighbors, allies, and community members to stand together, to reject hate in all its forms, and to embrace the values of acceptance, compassion, and love.\"\nOn Monday, Easton Police Deputy Chief Greg Wright said the agency will increase patrol this week at Sts. Peter and Paul School and other schools in town. He said police \"have no reason to believe that there was any attempt or desire to harm anyone.\"\nBOND DECISION\nBridgette Lane, an assistant at the Talbot County public defender's office, argued in court on Monday that King should be granted release based on the low severity of charges, an otherwise clean criminal record and the Detention Center's recommendation.\nLane said King has \"expressed remorse\" and understands \"she can't be acting out in these ways.\"\nKing, who is listed as having a Baltimore address, was recently staying in Easton with her mother, Lane said. If released, the expectation was for King to stay with her mother.\nTalbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said the graffiti incident is concerning due to the context of the Minneapolis shooting last month, as well as the fact that King's mother's house is close to the school.\n\"Here we have this clear warning sign,\" Coale said. \" ... We don't know if the defendant is capable of carrying out something worse. But the state doesn't want to find out.\"\nKetterman said both sides made good points, but she hammered home that there are \"no conditions of release\" that would ensure the safety of the community. The judge said she's concerned about the location of the graffiti and King's documented mental health diagnoses, which include bipolar disorder and PTSD.\n\"I don't think the court has another choice,\" Ketterman said after ruling no bond and ordering the defendant complete a mental health evaluation.\nInformation from The Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Townsend, Orrell lead Warriors\n\n April 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 679\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — They weren't together when they spoke, but all three struck a similar theme.\"We needed this win going into next week,\" Easton High head softball coach Ryan Brice said Wednesday after the Warrriors churned out 16 hits en route to an 18-0 feel-good victory in five innings over Wicomico.\n\"We needed it big time,\" said Olivia Orrell, who celebrated senior day by launching a two-run homer to center field that gave Easton a 3-0 first-inning lead.\n\"I think the whole team needed it,\" chimed junior pitcher Sammy Townsend, who registered a season-high 15 strikeouts while spinning a three-hitter.\nOne day after getting blanked for the first time this year by two-time defending North Bayside champion North Dorchester, Easton (7-4) faced a Wicomico team that has yet to win this season. Sure, the Warriors were a heavy favorite, and took care of business early on the way to just their second win in five games.\nBut with key dates looming with Kent Island and Cambridge-South Dorchester next week, Easton not only got a desired result against the Indians (0-9) but a much-needed boost of confidence.\n\"We needed all the hits today because the past couple games we haven't really been hitting,\" said Orrell, who finished 3 or 4 with three RBIs, four runs scored and her second homer of the season. \"So I think that boosted our confidence level. And it definitely boosted the team morale.\"\nBrice agreed, especially after last week's losses to Stephen Decatur and Colonel Richardson, and Tuesday's setback at North Dorchester.\n\"Dropping the couple games last week really affected us,\" Brice said. \"So we really needed this one today so we can get some traction going into the meat of the season. We have Kent Island coming up. We have Cambridge coming up. Those are good ball clubs so we got to be on our toes.\"\nTownsend (3-3) seemed to be on her game from the beginning, fanning the first two batters she faced before plunking Amber Moore, and then striking out Aleah Shah to end the first.\n\"I feel my curve was really tight today, and I feel my riser was good as well,\" said Townsend, who notched all 15 outs via strikeout. \"I feel like I had a natural rise going on today and I got a lot of hitters out with that. I was focused. I feel like this is what we needed.\"\nJoseline Gabriel singled through the left side of the infield with one out in the second inning for Wi-Hi's first hit. But Townsend fanned the next two batters to end the frame, then struck out the side swinging in the third.\nThe Indians had their best chance to spoil Townsend's shutout bid in the fourth. Shah hit a one-out single to right and advanced to second on an error. Townsend struck out Kennedi Hull. Gabriel then reached on an error, sending Shah to third. But the Indians' lone baserunner to reach third would remain there, as Townsend got an inning-ending strikeout.\n\"I can't say enough about Sammy,\" Brice said. \"There was freshman sensation, then sophomore sensation. Now, she's a junior sensation. She needed this win as well. She had a couple of rough outings the past couple of games, but she needed the win.\"\nWicomico put two runners on in the fifth with two outs, but Townsend punctuated Easton's third shutout of the year with her 15th K.\nAfter scoring three runs on four hits in the first, Easton batted around in the second, pushing six more runs across with five hits. Gemma Vogel (2 for 3) opened the inning with a double, stole third and scored on an error. Lyla Roe (2 for 3, RBI), Orrell, and Townsend (3 for 4) each stroked singles in the rally, and Lane Kennedy (2 for 4, 2 RBIs) doubled.\nEaston widened its lead to 12-0 in the third before scoring six more in the fourth.\n\"We did what we were supposed to do today,\" Brice said. \"I can't complain. We hit the ball very well today. We haven't in the past couple of games. So today hopefully going into next week we keep the bats rolling.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This means he will serve no jail time.\nAdams said Schwaninger will have to serve five years of supervised probation, register as a Tier I sex offender and submit to supervision, meaning that he will have to comply with a sex offender management program.\nThe state agreed not to prosecute the remaining four charges Schwaninger faced.\nBefore handing down Schwaninger's sentence, Adams said that by obtaining and possessing the videos, Schwaninger was participating in the child pornography industry.\n\"The most important thing we can all do is protect children,\" she said.\nDuring the plea hearing, Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale gave descriptions of the four videos that Schwaninger pleaded guilty to having. He said the children in the videos were real children, not created by artificial intelligence.\nCoale said that although Schwaninger had not manufactured the videos, his \"participation in that market allows the market to flourish.\"\nSchwaninger's attorney Thomas Maronick Jr. said his client \"looked at some pictures he should not have\" and didn't distribute them. Maronick said Schwaninger has since met with a counselor experienced in treating sex offenders. Maronick said the counselor did not feel that Schwaninger had a problem that requires \"lengthy\" therapy.\nThis was \"a crime of curiosity,\" Maronick said, later adding that Schwaninger didn't realize the industry he was supporting.\nSchwaninger told Adams that he came across the videos on social media toward the end of 2023.\n\"It was like watching a train wreck,\" he said about the videos. \"I know better.\"\nSchwaninger said the videos were on an old phone and didn't realize they were on the phone he was using at the time of his arrest. He said he thought he had deleted the videos. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He wanted to pitch.\"\nDustin Blue pitched three-plus innings of two-hit ball before running into a jam in the fourth inning, but by then the Warriors had built a lead that was never in jeopardy en route to an emotional 11-2 victory.\n\"He wanted to play last night,\" Pritchett said of Dustin Blue. \"As soon as we knew (of Matt's passing), the kids, the players and families wanted to play. We felt that was the best way to honor Matt. Matt would have wanted us to play. I think we showed it was the right decision.\"\nMatt Blue was a three-sport athlete at Easton High before graduating in 2002. He went on to play goalkeeper for Salisbury University's soccer team before returning to teach in Talbot County. The former boys' head soccer coach at Easton High, he was diagnosed with cancer in December, 2022. Matt continued teaching at Easton Middle School, and remained an assistant on Easton's varsity baseball team until he passed Friday. Matt Blue was 40 years old.\n\"I thought the kids responded,\" Pritchett said. \"They loved Matt Blue. They loved the coach. The community has a tremendous loss. It's going to be hard to replace him. I don't think we will.\n\"So I thought the kids, in the face of a lot of emotion, a lot of feelings, and a lot of loss, they did a good job,\" Pritchett continued. \"They were here together playing the sport they love, supporting Dustin, the family. I'm very proud of them.\"\nMatt Blue gave a speech prior to last year's St. Michaels at Easton game on April 13. Before Saturday's game, the public-address announcer reminded players, coaches and the large home crowd settled behind the backstop of one of Blue's main themes of recognizing the moment.\nHis son did just that on a wind-chilled afternoon of gray clouds and big patches of blue sky.\n\"It's incredible,\" Southern head coach Kyle Lynch said of Dustin. \"The effort. Obviously the emotion. You don't know what's going through his head, but he threw tremendously. He was great. We have a lot respect for them and coach Pritchett. But what Dustin did was truly pretty special. Been around baseball for a long time and haven't seen anything like that.\"\nDustin's first pitch of the game was a strike to Thomas Martin. He got Martin on a grounder to short, then hit JC Wilson with a pitch. Easton catcher Colin Moody threw out Wilson trying to steal second then watched Dustin get a called strike three on Gavin Crandall to end the inning.\nEaston's starting pitcher issued a one-out walk to Owen Meyers in the second, induced Andrew Cook into a fielder's choice, then zipped a pickoff throw to first that led to Cook getting caught in an inning-ending rundown.\nSouthern's Brendan Hinkle was hit by a pitch to lead off the third. But Nick Youmans grounded into a fielder's choice, struck out Dylan Clarke looking before Martin hit a deep fly that Warrior left fielder Carter Mooney made a nice play on.\nWilson lined Dustin's first offering of the fourth sharply through the middle for Southern's first hit. Wilson was erased on a fielder's choice. O'Brien was then hit by a pitch before Meyers dumped a singled into shallow left, loading the bases. Cook hit into a fielder's choice to plate the Bulldogs' first run before Pritchett came out to relieve Dustin with Garrett Fink.\n\"I thought he threw great,\" Pritchett said of Dustin (2-0), who remained in the game at shortstop. \"I think (he threw) 60-something percent strikes. He commanded all three of his pitches. Again under a tremendous amount of pressure and emotion. Just showed a lot of character; lot of grit. It's a tremendous effort again in the face of tremendous loss and emotion. He's a tough kid. I'm proud of him.\"\nEaston (3-1) scored all the runs it needed during a six-run second inning — all with two outs — against Bulldogs starter Crandall (1-1). Carter Mooney began the scoring, lining a stand-up RBI double down the left-field line. After Cullen Murphy walked, Dylan Cassell roped another run-producing double to left. Murphy scored on a wild pitch. Josh Dressler (2 for 4) singled to score Cassell for a 4-0 lead. Dressler eventually scored on a wild pitch before Dustin capped the scoring with an infield, RBI single.\nThe Warriors tacked on another five runs with two outs in the third for an 11-0 bulge. Murphy singled to center off reliever Rhett Dorval and was lifted for courtesy runner Mikey O'Connor. Cassell was hit by a pitch. Dressler singled into the hole at short, plating O'Connor. CJ Dugan (2 for 4) delivered the inning's big blow with a two-run single. Dustin (2 for 4) followed with an infield single.\nFink, who escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fourth, yielded a run in the fifth, but didn't give up a hit in two innings. He was relieved with two outs in the bottom of the sixth by O'Connor, who struck out three of the five batters he faced to close the win.\n\"I think it's a healthy distraction,\" Pritchett said of playing the game. \"I think the kids needed it. They wanted it. And they proved it was a good decision for all of them. I thought their energy was high. They were positive despite the emotion.\"\nAfter the game, Pritchett handed the game-ball to Dustin.\n\"Dustin looked fabulous,\" Pritchett said.\nCOLONEL 10, NORTH DORCHESTER 5\nAMERICAN CORNER — Senior Daniel Hesson hurled a complete game Saturday morning, striking out nine, as the Colonels remained undefeated.\nDerrick Mitchell hit a two-run homer for Colonel Richardson (5-0) and finished with three RBIs. Jordan Regulski and Johnny Beaven each had two hits.\nSOFTBALL\nNORTH DORCHESTER 7, COLONEL 2\nAMERICAN CORNER — Emilee Cohee surrendered four hits, struck out 12 and issued one walk Saturday as the defending Class 1A state champions stayed unbeaten.\nCohee, Mackenzie Lewis, Maggie Hubbard and Maddie Nagel (two RBIs) each had two hits for the Eagles.\nMakayla Newcomb suffered her first loss of the season as North Dorchester totaled 11 hits. Newcomb struck out six and walked two. Aubrey Taylor led Colonel with two hits, including a double.\nQUEEN ANNE'S 8, CHESAPEAKE 5\nCENTREVILLE — Abbie Denes blasted a three-run homer in the first inning and Autumn Huber was 3 for 4 with a four-inning homer Saturday to lead the Lions.\nCaroline Taylor and Reece Brooks each had multiple-hit games for Queen Anne's. Hannah Martin earned the win, allowing just one run and four hits over six innings.\nBOYS LACROSSE\nEASTON 9, STEPHEN DECATUR 8\nBERLIN — Drew Schmidt scored the game-winner in overtime Friday night as the Warriors edged the Seahawks in a rematch of last year's Bayside Conference championship.\nSchmidt finished with a hat trick, Hudson Royer had four goals and an assist, and Tyler Rardin added two goals for Easton (1-1). Warrior goalie Jack Kilbourne made 11 saves.\nGIRLS LACROSSE\nNORTH CAROLINE 14, J.M. BENNETT 5\nSALISBURY — Claire Blue scored four goals and Riley Walstrum had a hat trick to go with three assists Friday to pace the Bulldogs.\nReece Bisesi and Ashlynn Bisesi (assist) had two goals apiece for North Caroline.

A second survey taken two weeks later showed the same thing. According to the news release, the fractures were \"deemed highly indicative of non-accidental injury\" by Johns Hopkins medical staff.\nAccording to the news release, witnesses at trial testified they had observed Kautz shaking the 1-year-old boy on multiple occasions in 2022. Witnesses also testified to observing bruises on the child's body when he was returned from visitations with Kautz.\n\"These cases involve children who are too young to testify or to speak on their own behalf and are therefore difficult to prosecute,\" Talbot County State's Attorney Joseph Coale said in the news release. \"We are extremely grateful to the investigators at the Talbot County Department of Social Services, Easton Police Department and to the doctors at Johns Hopkins who came together to achieve justice in this case.\"\nKautz's sentencing is scheduled for June 10. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "How much growth is too much for Easton? Balance between housing needs, infrastructure unsettled\n\n August 30, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 1988\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The predicament on the minds of many Easton residents and leaders continues to be just how much the town can afford to grow.Easton is under a period of significant residential growth with multiple large-scale housing projects under construction. In 2000, the town's population was 11,708, according to census data. Ten years later, it rose to 15,945, and since, it's grown at a slower pace to 17,101 in 2020.\nThe boom has raised a litany of concerns, from increased traffic to a change in the town's small-town complexion.\nSome residents, and a few officials, think Easton should press the brake pedal. But local real estate agents contend that a halt to growth could box out lower- and middle-class buyers and renters.\nMartha Witte Suss, an associate broker for Coldwell Banker Realty and Easton resident, said the housing market has been in a crunch since the pandemic. She said there's not enough reasonably priced homes or rentals to satisfy employees who commute from outside Talbot County.\n\"We have plenty of housing that they can't afford,\" Suss said. Residential growth, if it focuses on affordability, could cure that dry spell, she added.\nMichael Ports, vice chair of the Easton Planning Commission, poses the town's conundrum like this: \"What are the housing needs of the people currently, and can we achieve that in a way that doesn't compromise everyone's needs for services?\"\nIt's a question town leaders are taking on, even if there's no easy answer.\nThis fall, 136 apartments on Elliott Road will begin opening. Two large communities are under construction east of Route 50, combining for over 450 projected single-family homes. Near Easton's downtown, a developer plans to transform two former Perdue AgriBusiness sites into housing projects, totaling 144 units.\nIn all, roughly 1,127 units are recently finished, under construction or approved by the town's public bodies, according to information from town planners and developers of the 17 listed projects.\nThe pipeline of projects has yielded varying opinions from town leaders. Some don't want any new large housing projects approved in the next few years. Others prefer a case-by-case approach.\nMayor Megan Cook said the right answer is \"probably somewhere in between.\" The town should focus on the current projects but not be too quick to disregard new ones, she said.\nThe mayor said growth is a charged topic and especially complicated due to affordable housing needs. No solution is a \"silver bullet,\" Cook and others have repeatedly said.\n\"It is a balancing act,\" Town Council President Don Abbatiello said. \"There would have to be a project come along that would fit that need, that workforce housing, that affordable housing piece.\"\nIn interviews with The Star Democrat, Easton officials weighed in on the town's current list of housing developments. When asked about infrastructure, the most recognized concerns included roads, fire and police services and schools.\nThey offered thoughts on where the town should focus its residential growth. Most leaned toward building from the inside-out. Planning Commission Chairperson Phil Toussaint is of that opinion. He hopes the sprawling, single-family developments are coming to an end.\n\"We wouldn't really want to support any development on the outskirts at all,\" Toussaint said.\nAnd broadly, the 1,127-unit mark can be misleading since some units aren't under construction and may not be for years, Toussaint and others said.\n\"(People) think they're gonna appear tomorrow,\" Toussaint said. \"They're not.\"\nSingle-family home neighborhoods typically take years to build out, such as Easton Village off of St. Michaels Road, a project of around 250 homes first approved in 2003 and just now reaching completion. So far, the 200-home Gannon Range and 252-home Four Seasons projects only have 18 and 11 building permits, respectively, according to Easton planning and zoning director Miguel Salinas.\n\"It's a daunting number. It's hard to hear,\" said Cook, who as mayor doesn't have a vote on housing applications. \"But at the same time, you look at some of the examples as a community, the neighborhoods that we've had. They're built out over 20 years.\"\nTHE PIPELINE\nSince town planners prepared a list of Easton housing projects this winter, chatter of \"the pipeline\" has been frequent at Town Council and Planning Commission meetings. Those two bodies are responsible for approving most of the projects.\nThe commission is made up of volunteer members and often can only make a recommendation to the council, whose members are elected. But sometimes, the commission holds final say, such as when it approved the 116-apartment Easton Crossing complex on Brookletts Avenue this year.\nThe five members of the council and six members of the commission offer a range of opinions when it comes to the town's growth.\nTown Council Ward 3 representative David Montgomery provided perhaps the most rigid perspective.\n\"I want to stop for at least five years before we add anything more to this backlog,\" Montgomery said. \"I want to see how fast it actually grows, it's actually built out.\"\nOthers were less firm on completely stopping growth, though all council members interviewed for this story said, at the very least, the town needs to be mindful. Some prefer a project-by-project approach, such as Abbatiello, who said future housing proposals need to be the \"right fit\" for Easton.\n\"I think right now, there's enough in the pipeline for us to say, 'Let's see how the projects impact the town's resources before we go adding a lot more to that list,'\" Abbatiello said.\nPlanning Commission members have mixed thoughts, too.\nPorts, the commission's vice chair, said Easton is \"missing a good bit\" even with the current project inventory. He said the missing units largely fall between expensive single-family homes and for-rent apartments — a sphere urban planners call \"the missing middle.\"\n\"The reality is that the median sale price of a home right now is almost twice what a family of four making the absolute average income here in Easton can afford,\" Ports said. According to Maryland Realtors, the July 2025 median sales price in Talbot County was $545,000, the third highest in the state.\nTom Klein was the commission's lone vote against the Easton Crossing project, citing traffic and parking concerns. He said the need for more affordable housing is clear. But Klein would prefer to have a target number. At times, it feels like Easton is \"chasing something\" it doesn't know, he said.\n\"How many more do we need? Do we just keep assuming we keep needing more?\" Klein asked. \"That, to me, is something I don't really know the answer to. I think it would be helpful to know that so we don't just blindly build.\"\n'MORE AND MORE CROWDED'\nTown planners and engineers have processes to gauge the impacts residential projects will have on the town, such as traffic and environmental studies or reviews by the town's nonprofit utility, sewer and water company, Easton Utilities.\nEven with project-specific studies, many town leaders believe traffic is a top-of-list concern, along with other infrastructure matters.\nMontgomery said town staff should be \"much more skeptical about the traffic impact studies\" submitted alongside housing proposals. Ward 4 representative the Rev. Elmer Davis said the traffic issue is obvious to the human eye.\n\"I don't need a traffic study to tell me that the traffic in Easton, periodically, is a problem at best,\" Davis said.\nHandling traffic backups is a tricky matter, Cook said, since some roads are state-run, others are under county purview and many downtown are maintained by town engineers and public works employees.\nOff of Route 328, or Matthewstown Road, 136 apartments are opening soon, while 200 single-family homes will be built just down the road. It's an area residents have flagged during council and state transportation meetings.\n\"(Route) 328 is going to become busier and busier, and folks, I fear, are going to have more and more challenges getting out to (Route) 50,\" said Councilmember Robert Rankin, who represents residents in the Route 328 area.\nA State Highway Administration planning and environmental study is underway to assess pedestrian and traffic needs on the busy state road that funnels onto Ocean Gateway. Previously proposed concepts by the state include adding left-turn lanes on Matthewstown Road and adding a second through lane on Goldsborough Road as drivers cross Route 50.\nTraffic has consistently been brought up as a reason to lean away from annexing land for residential growth outside of Easton's core. Nearly all commission and council members interviewed for this story said they prefer to keep growth within the area encircled by Route 50 and Easton Parkway (322).\nThe Planning Commission has especially expressed that preference during workshops updating the town's comprehensive plan, which lays out the town's vision for handling growth in the next decade.\nIn July, the commission rejected the Fox Chase Estates, a 365-unit, mixed-use development proposed near a warehouse and industrial park north of Easton Airport and near the under-construction Shore Regional Health hospital. Town Council members maintain final voting power on the project, though it's unclear when or if it will come before them.\nThe Planning Commission voted unanimously to recommend against the development, citing a lack of connectivity as a main reason. The vote lines up with the commission's recent direction as they draft the new comprehensive plan: build from the inside-out.\n\"We'd rather see infill,\" Klein said. \"We want to see connected neighborhoods.\"\nThat line of thinking, shared by many Town Council members, still leaves Easton with infrastructure challenges, such as downtown streets, utilities and safety. The latter was emphasized by Cook and council members as a chief priority.\nFunding for the Easton Police Department and Easton Volunteer Fire Department makes up around 40% of the town's general fund budget. Abbatiello, who volunteers for the fire company, wants to hold off a massive increase in the cost for fire services by maintaining the department's volunteer status for \"as (long) as possible.\"\n\"The biggest tax increase residents of Easton are ever going to see is if the Town of Easton needs to go to a paid (fire) department,\" Abbatiello said.\nEaston Utilities evaluates water demands annually. According to a statement from Doug Abbott, director of engineering and water/wastewater departments, the utility is using 60% of its water and wastewater capabilities, leaving 40% \"to accommodate future growth.\"\nAnd as for downtown traffic, some town leaders are worried infill will do more harm than good.\n\"Our streets are becoming more and more crowded, and I am concerned the more that we have infill development, the harder it is to maneuver around this town,\" Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said at a comprehensive plan workshop Aug. 25.\n\"I just don't accept that assumption,\" Toussaint, the commission chair, later said. He argued that concentrating growth downtown will take cars off town streets and improve walkability.\nOverall, the Aug. 25 meeting yielded a key takeaway: the new comprehensive plan is likely to include a preferred annual population growth rate around 1.75%. Planners initially proposed not to mark an annual growth rate in the plan, a change from the 2010 version, which stamped the rate at 1%.\nTown Planner Lynn Thomas said at the meeting that without a growth rate, the plan would use historic projections to determine if the town should consider adopting policies to remedy growth trends either \"significantly lower or significantly higher\" than expected.\nBut Town Council members said a rate should be clearly stated to keep the town honest.\n\"I do think it would be helpful to have at least something to point toward,\" Rankin said. The Planning Commission will adjust the drafted plan later this fall, likely reinstating an annual growth rate, before hosting a public hearing.\nThe town's Affordable Housing Board and Attainable Housing Task Force are other bodies taking cracks at addressing the housing-growth debate. The task force is currently producing a list of recommended housing policies for the Town Council to consider.\nCook acknowledged that while town boards and discussions are great, \"actionable items\" — such as the comprehensive plan and policies — are on the way and will bring true benefits to residents. But nevertheless, she's happy Easton is addressing its growth problem head-on.\n\"No one else around here is having these conversations, but the Town of Easton is,\" Cook said. \"They're difficult conversations. They're polarizing conversations, they're very emotional conversations. But we're having them.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

However, the events of the past few days have made it impossible to ignore what is happening in our town.The following is a listing of actions taken by one of the candidates and his supporters that have been embarrassing, juvenile, not how we treat each and, quite frankly, I would never have guessed that these types of behavior would even be thought of in Talbot County.I was first approached the day when first responders were saluted at the Dover Street Memorial. I was told that I should not consider running for the Easton Council president's seat but withdraw and give my personal support to his candidate.I didn't give it anymore attention until a few weeks later a call from his secretary to arrange a meeting.When I went to the meeting, I was surprised that the candidate and another employee were present. A little tacky I thought when the conversation started.You need to withdraw and give your support to my candidate and do it publicly.You cannot win. You have accomplished all you can, and someone with new ideas needs to take over. It was also indicated that I was to old. Stunned, I left the office.Then I see a letter in the Talbot Spy indicating the candidate was furious about the way Easton was being managed. He listed five or six items that to him were damaging and demanding answers. I had lawyers look at the questions and provide answers. All were determined to have been handled appropriately and no further action was necessary.Some of the issues were even brought forth in open session and voted on by the council The candidate included.At this time, the candidate really crossed the line with me. He brought my wife into the picture by complaining about her insurance coverage.For years, the town has included elected officials and spouses on the group Insurance, the candidate included.Then the mailings star, four to date, that really serve no purpose other than to spread misinformation and get people aroused. The person who evidently funds this debacle also mentions my wife by name.I am having a difficult time understanding why so much money is being spent on a position that pays so little money. What am I missing?ROBERT C. WILLEYEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Which streamer premieres a brand-new comedy film starring Awkwafina (\"Renfield,\" 2023) and Sandra Oh (\"Grey's Anatomy\") on Friday, Nov. 3? The answer is Hulu, and the film in question is \"Quiz Lady,\" a buddy comedy about two sisters who come together to win a quiz show and save a dog.Awkwafina is Anna, the reliable, type-A sister who is called away from her work as an accountant when her mom's senior living facility reaches out to let Anna know that they had lost her mom - but not to the afterlife.The attendant corrects herself in the trailer, telling Anna, \"Sorry, that was terrible phrasing. I meant we don't know where she is.\" After making it to the facility, Anna is joined by her estranged and distraught sister Jenny, portrayed by Oh, whose purple highlights, oversized sunglasses and flamboyant personal style contrast with Anna's head-to-toe grey wardrobe. Anna is clued in to her mother's whereabouts when a bookie informs her that her beloved pet pug, Mr. Linguini, has been kidnapped and is being held hostage over her mother's massive gambling debts.With the debts creeping up her back and seniors home infractions stacking up, Anna and Jenny's mom flees to Macau, leaving them to sort out what she owes and be reunited with Mr. Linguini. Anna's salary isn't quite generous enough to settle their mother's $80,000 tab, and Jenny's constant search for her latest passion hasn't resulted in financial stability. Two weeks is all they're given to cough up the funds.The siblings are at a loss for ways to get rich quick until Jenny sees Anna participate in her favorite game show, \"Can't Stop the Quiz,\" from her sofa. The show is must-watch television for Anna, who tunes in daily, usually accompanied by her canine companion, and effortlessly answers every single question correctly. Seeing Anna in her element turns on a light bulb over Jenny's head.It's decided, then, that the pair will travel to Los Angeles, get Anna on \"Can't Stop the Quiz,\" and all their problems will be solved when she wins. Leaving the safety of her routine life in Philadelphia behind, Anna joins Jenny on a wild road trip across the United States and embraces her sister's chaotic, adventurous way of life. Neither of them is completely certain that Anna's trivia skills will transfer from the comfort of her couch to the pressure of the game show's set, but this is the best chance they've got to scrape together enough money to bring Mr. Linguini home unharmed.Having spent years apart, estranged over their differences, Anna and Jenny have a lot of ground to cover - geographically and emotionally - on their road trip. Anna's strictly balanced life greatly differs from her sister Jenny's listless pursuit of purpose. They have things to learn from each other, whether it's how to let loose and go on an adventure or focus enough to successfully achieve a goal.\"The element that really attracted me was the sister dynamic,\" director Jessica Yu told Deadline at the world premiere of \"Quiz Lady\" at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. She added, \"For one thing, I just haven't seen a lot of comedies about sisters, and the fact that at the center of this was two Asian-American sisters, made me think, 'Oh, this will be really fun to explore.'\" \n \n Caption: Sandra Oh and Awkwafina in \"Quiz Lady\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

My neighbor, a gentleman in his 50s, saw me smoking a cigarette the other day and decided to take it upon himself to lecture me on the dangers of smoking.Although I appreciated his concern, his lecture was unwelcome. I intend to quit smoking at some point, but I don't need my neighbor to intervene. I fear that the next time I bump into him, he will give me another lecture. What can I do to make him understand that his unsolicited advice is not helping? I'm a grown adult, and I don't need lectures. - Good IntentionsDEAR GOOD INTENTIONS: As you know, your neighbor expressed his concerns out of genuine care for you. Remember that when you speak to him. It is your right to do whatever you want with your life and your body. Provided that the cigarette smoke is not contaminating your neighbors' air, you should be able to smoke in peace.That said, it is likely that this man will either say something or scowl at you the next time he sees a cigarette in your hand. Can you say something?Yes, but be careful. You can thank him for his concern, but put up a guardrail. Tell him you know what you are doing. When you decide to quit, you will.

These sensitivities are rich. You don't own Christ's image. And you can't use the political process to impose your brand of Christian beliefs on the public and expect others not to see it as fair game for cartoonists.As a born-again Christian, I felt called to run for state Senate in 2018. Matthew 25 was my platform where Jesus says whatever you do for the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, those needing clothes, the sick and those in prison you do for Me.I was at my beautiful church, New St. John's in Wittman, and was called up at the last minute to read the new testament scripture and the lectionary reading happened to include that portion of Matthew 25.That settled the debate in my head about whether to run.Before I moved to the Eastern Shore in 2010, a friend and I had a nursing home ministry where we would visit six nursing homes to conduct worship and prayer services.Since coming here, I had a worship service in the Alzheimer's unit at the Pines for four years. I studied a year of clinical pastoral education and served as an on-call chaplain at the Easton Hospital.Today I visit the women in the Talbot County Detention Center.The shame today, of course, is that one party has been wrapping itself in the cloak of Christianity for the past decade, insisting our pluralistic country is a Christian country and promoting policies that exclude the LGBTQ+ community.They even insisted that restricting gatherings including church attendance during the early days of the pandemic was anti-Christian.Their efforts to impose an abortion ban is organized around certain faith-based communities.Our beautiful country is a pluralistic one.Churches, synagogues and mosques are simply human institutions and churches in particular have shrinking attendance. These Christians should develop a sense of humor and recognize that they can't play in the public square and not expect to be called out for it.HOLLY WRIGHTEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Sail Selina II to set sail in St. Michaels for final season\n\n April 12, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 661\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS — After nearly a century on the water and more than two decades guiding passengers along the Miles River, the Sail Selina II will be sailing into retirement later this year.Following its upcoming season, which begins next week, Captain Iris Robertson will be retiring. But before it departs the Bay following the end of its season in November, Sail Selina II is going out with a bang.\nThe boat is joining the National Park Service's Chesapeake Gateways Network, a network of places that offer opportunities for visitors to learn about and enjoy the Chesapeake Bay.\nRobertson said in the last 25 years, she estimates close to 60,000 people have stepped aboard Sail Selina II. Some of those passengers, she said, might not have gotten out on the water otherwise.\n\"The Bay is very fragile,\" Robertson said. \"It's at risk right now. And (for) folks that live in Pennsylvania, (it's) out of sight, out of mind. But they're on the watershed. And Selina's just been a wonderful way for people to connect to something that they participate in even though it's not necessarily in their backyard.\"\nOn April 24, there will be a ribbon cutting ceremony at the Harbour Inn Marina in St. Michaels to welcome Sail Selina II into the Chesapeake Gateways Network for its final season. The event will include remarks from National Park Service Chesapeake Gateways Superintendent Wendy O'Sullivan.\nGENERATIONS ON THE WATERAlthough Robertson, who lives in Royal Oak, has been the captain of Sail Selina II for 25 years, her history with the boat stretches back to before she was born.\nIn 1926, Robertson's grandfather had the boat commissioned. Her grandparents kept the boat for 36 years before passing it down to Robertson's parents in 1962. In 2001, Robertson became Sail Selina II's third steward.\n\"From the time I was about 12, even though I've got older siblings, everybody knew she would come to me,\" Robertson said. \"I was the kid that was aboard, participating, had the interest.\"\nRobertson made the decision to charter the boat so that she could afford to maintain it.\nAfter Sail Selina II's final charter season, Robertson plans to pass the yacht down to her niece, who happens to live in Greenport, New York, where Sail Selina II was built.\n\"It's like a full-circle thing,\" Robertson said about the sailing yacht. \"She's 100 years old. She's going back to the town she was built in.\"\nRobertson said she knows her grandparents and father, who have since died, would be so proud of the boat's Chesapeake Gateways designation.\n\"I think they'd be tickled pink to know how much she has contributed to people's joy and experience over the last 25 years,\" Robertson said.\nSTEPPING ABOARDWith a 1,000-square-foot canvas sail, the 44-foot-long Sail Selina II is a \"stable\" and \"regal\" sailing yacht, Robertson said.\n\"We have a lot of guests that have never been on boats before, and they're a little bit nervous when they first step on,\" she said. \"But by the time they get off, they go, 'Oh my God, this was like being on a flying magic carpet ride.'\"\nFrom wine and beer tasting cruises, to sunset sails, to engagement cruises, to weddings, to private sailing lessons, there are many options for those who want to set sail on Sail Selina II. Robertson said the standard two-hour tour takes passengers around St. Michaels Harbor before cruising out to the Miles River and putting up sails.\n\"We let the wind determine our course,\" Robertson said. \"And before you know it, two hours has gone by.\"\nRepeat passenger Gene Pisasale said he and his wife love sailing on Sail Selina II because they love being out on the water and they love sailing with Robertson.\n\"She's got to be the friendliest boat captain on the Chesapeake,\" said Pisasale, who lives in Pennsylvania. \"And she is just a gem, a real gem. A pleasure to sail with.\"\nTo charter Sail Selina II during its last season, visit sailselina.com/ or call 410-726-9400.

That continues to be the case,\" Weber said. \" … There's a complexity to human trafficking that it doesn't really know county boundaries.\"\nWeber and Katie Theeke, vice president of marketing and communications, each said the organization has a special role given its wide reach. For All Seasons' presence in the five Mid-Shore counties — Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot — is critical to providing victims with essential services.\n\"We know that human trafficking knows no boundaries and that it affects people of different backgrounds, races, genders,\" Theeke said. \"We have seen several cases come through our doors, and it comes from Talbot County. It comes from neighboring counties. We really aim to be the connector to get those people the help that they need.\"\nCouncil Member Keasha Haythe asked if For All Seasons is seeing a decline in human trafficking numbers. Weber said it's a \"double-edged sword.\"\n\"A year ago we sat in front of you and said, when we look at our rape crisis center data, a good fifth of what was coming in was having at least one indicator of human trafficking,\" Weber said. \" … That persists.\"\nThe organization has noticed a shift in how many people are recognizing signs of human trafficking and making those reports, Weber says.\n\"The folks that are self-referring, we're seeing a decline,\" she said. \"But we're seeing a real rapid incline in folks coming to us and saying, 'Hey, I know more and now I've seen something.'\"\nWeber said that since September, more than 120 people have taken For All Seasons' free, online anti-human trafficking course.\nFor All Seasons is an official regional navigator for the Mid-Shore area, Theeke said, meaning it works on task forces and serves youth and young adults that are victims of trafficking.\nAt the end of the discussion, council members thanked the For All Seasons representatives for their work and presented the organization with a proclamation Tuesday declaring January as National Human Trafficking Awareness Month.\n\"We know that even one victim is too many,\" council Vice President Pete Lesher said. \"We appreciate all that you do both on prevention, but also to develop and take care of those who have been victims.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Austin Frank drilled a leadoff double to center field. Colton Maans walked and was lifted for courtesy runner Wes Thomas. Eric Deck (2 for 3) singled to center, scoring Frank. Gavin Whitby (2 for 3) singled to load the bases before Johnny Radcliff grounded out, scoring Thomas to make it 3-2\nBut Spurry ended the threat there, getting a strikeout before catcher Nicolopolous alertly grabbed a ball that was chopped in front of the plate and tagged Caleb Cole for an inning-ending, unassisted putout.\nCaroline rallied to pull even in the top of the sixth on Whitby's one-out RBI single. Again, Spurry escaped any further damage, retiring two of the next three batters to keep it at 3-3 heading into the home half of the sixth.\n\"Threw strikes,\" Talbot manager Albert Pritchett said of Spurry, who finished with four strikeouts and two walks. \"Got ahead of every batter, mixed it up. Very impressive.\"\nTalbot (1-0) took a 1-0 lead in the home first. Frank issued back-to-back walks to Gavin Murphy and Couper Barletta. Two batters later, Pearson Greenwood laced a double to right field, plating Murphy. Frank squelched the rally there, getting Ethan Royer to pop out and Jesus Crespo on a comebacker to the mound.\nPost 70 pushed its lead to 2-0 in the second. Brennen Griffin (2 for 2) hit a leadoff single and Nathan Merchant walked. Spurry then hit an 0-2 offering into left-center field for a double that scored Griffin. Again Frank extinguished a potential big rally, striking out the next three straight batters.\nTalbot made it 3-0 in the third, as Tim McGuckin worked a leadoff walk, stole second, advanced to third on Greenwood's groundout to first, and scored when Crespo singled sharply to left field.\nCaroline pulled even in the sixth before Talbot moved back in front in the home sixth. Nicolopoulos worked a leadoff walk against Post 29 reliever Chase Hitchens then stole second. Hitchens came off the mound to catch Brody McDaniel's bunt attempt for the first out. Nicolopoulos advanced to third on an errant pickoff attempt. Spurry then grounded out deep in the hole at shortstop, allowing Nicolopolous to score what proved to be the winning run.\n\"Knocked in the winning run for himself,\" Pritchett said of Spurry. \"Nice game.\n\"First game, little rusty,\" said Pritchett, who was without Cullen Murphy, Josh Dressler and Anthony Massaro Tuesday. \"Some of the guys haven't played since high school (season ended). We could have had a few more runs, but I think the hitting will come around.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Always plenty to be thankful for in Maryland\n\n November 23, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editorials \n \n 740\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n It should be easy for most of us to be thankful in Maryland. Thanksgiving has just about arrived, that special day for reflection, for sharing our gratitude and for enjoying a splendidly large meal with those we love.We've mostly been spared the political rancor that marked much of the election season nationwide. The local campaigning leading up to filling out our ballots earlier this fall was mostly crisp and clean.\nSo as we prepare ourselves for the Thanksgiving holiday, let's hope that peace and civility will prevail, at least for a day. Let's hope that when extended families convene for the old familiar feast, debate won't rage between red and blue, but about whether dark meat is more delicious than white meat as the turkey is carved.\nThanksgiving is a legacy of early colonial America, when European settlers thanked God for the harvest that allowed people to survive under difficult conditions. These days, of course, only a dwindling portion of our population here still has lives so closely tied to the harvest. Most of us take comfortable shelter and an adequate food supply for granted every day.\nDid you know that we have a president, a secretary of state and the author of \"Mary Had A Little Lamb\" to thank for Thanksgiving becoming a fully recognized holiday in the United States?\nEditor and writer Sarah Josepha Hale launched her campaign in 1827 to see the annual Thanksgiving tradition dating back a couple hundred years become an official holiday. She started with President John Quincy Adams — son of Founding Father John Adams — and finally found success many years later with President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. Secretary of State William Seward penned Lincoln's proclamation, which came in \"the midst of a civil war of unequalled magnitude and severity.\"\n\"I do, therefore, invite my fellow-citizens in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a Day of Thanksgiving and Praise to our beneficent Father who dwelleth in the heavens,\" Lincoln's proclamation reads.\nWell, 2024 has certainly been a year, but we still have so much to be thankful for, each and everyone of us.\nIn a way, we're all accidents of birth, and ongoing accidents of geography. We could be anywhere else in the world — and plenty of those places have more than enough misery to go around. Gratitude for our peace, safety and security here at home would be in order.\nWe should also be thankful for the people in our community who will be required to postpone their feasts to help others in need. We can take comfort in knowing that police and hospital staff will be on the job, and volunteer firefighters and other first responders could be pressed into service at any time if there's an emergency.\nThen there are those thoughtful souls who make sure that anyone who wants to come out can enjoy an absolutely free hot Thanksgiving family-style meal and fellowship. Food banks, soup kitchens and churches around the region help make sure that happens.\nFor sure, this holiday season that officially kicks off next week and runs all the way through New Year's Day can stretch time, money and sometimes patience particularly thin. But let's face it, most of us have plenty for which to be thankful. And we should have little reason not to feel blessed and grateful on Thanksgiving and every day.\nOur community is strong. And through the works large and small of all our friends and neighbors, we will only continue to get stronger. And for that, too, we offer our thanks.\nEven in our nation's darkest times, Lincoln and Seward found much to be celebrated: \"The year that is drawing toward its close has been filled with the blessings of fruitful fields and healthful skies. To these bounties, which are so constantly enjoyed that we are prone to forget the source from which they come, others have been added, which are of so extraordinary a nature that they cannot fail to penetrate and even soften the heart which is habitually insensible to the ever-watchful providence of Almighty God.\"\nWe can all take their words to heart as we head into the holiday season. We can look to the good. We can focus on the positive. We can find our way forward with thankfulness and love in our hearts.\nWe wish you all a happy Thanksgiving. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There was also bird song from the woods and the sound of bullfrogs from the pond.The crowd was large, with 300 tickets sold for the event. Multiple environmental groups and government agencies hosted information tables.\nEastern Redbud saplings were given out for attendees to plant at home by Francis Smith of the Maryland Forest Service. There were master gardeners and monarch butterfly experts. A birding trip led into the forest in the morning.\n\"Earth Day heightens our awareness and appreciation. It is joyful and good to get out. And it is fun to host this site to share with other local nonprofits,\" said Ginna Tiernan, executive director of Adkins.\n\"It reminds us to breathe, step out in nature. It is incredible for your soul, your brain,\" Tiernan said. \"It is amazing how clear you can think after a walk in the woods. I took a walk the other day, and a pileated woodpecker just swooped down in front of me. There were pine warblers in my ear. It is just affirming too that we are here on Earth with all of these animals, and we are a part of them.\"\nAdkins celebrated the global holiday a little early this year, with Earth Day actually falling on Monday.\nEarth Day is an annual event on April 22 to demonstrate support for environmental protection. First held on April 22, 1970, it now includes a wide range of events coordinated globally.\nJay Falstad, Adkins Arboretum board member and Executive Director of Queen Anne's Conservation Association, was using yellow and orange chalk to create a big sun at the arboretum's entrance.\n\"Earth Day is the one thing that we all share. We all share the same air, water and the same planet. We should all have an investment in protecting it,\" Falstad said.\nThere were many people who have worked hard to make this event happen. Not just organizing and planning but executing a fun educational experience.\nJenny Houghton, assistant director of Adkins Arboretum, said, \"We are partnering with other environmental organizations. We thought it would be nice to show people that we are all working together. We have Pickering Creek, Tuckahoe State Park, Maryland DNR, Bartlett Tree Experts, Shore Rivers, Talbot County Master Gardeners and Phillips Wharf Environmental Center.\"\n\"The highlight is getting people outside to celebrate nature together and listening to great music, eating local food and hopefully scooping up some tadpoles in the wetland. It is good to remind ourselves that the Earth is worth taking care of, because it is all that we have got,\" said Houghton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I remember a pamphlet that showed sinners drowning in a literal lake of fire for all eternity. Scary stuff.Author and pastor Rob Bell presents us with an interesting thought though — do we really believe that God, who loves us so much, is going to condemn billions of people, and reward only a select few with heaven? Will He really condemn these billions, throughout history, with eternal torment for things they did in a few short years of their life on Earth? It's not a question I would presume to know the answer to.\nI do know this, just as well as you do — our God is a God of love. He loves us so much that He gave His only begotten Son. Therefore, I prefer to substitute \"fear\" with \"love.\" For instance, Proverbs 1:7 tells us, \"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.\" I like to think that \"the love of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge.\"\nI must admit, I have no fear of the Lord. Instead, what I have is respect, reverence, awe, love and an appreciation of His love for me. The love He shows us cannot not be compared to anything else. The angels who appeared to the shepherds, in the Gospel of Luke, gave us good advice: \"Don't be afraid, because a savior is born.\"\nJesus came to us — God in the flesh — bringing love and salvation.\nIf we live a life of righteousness, following Christ, what do we have to fear? Nothing. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

He will be traveling to APG Chesapeake offices in Chestertown, Chester, La Plata, California, Prince Frederick, Dundalk and Elkton for the rest of the week.\nBaez was APG's Southern Wisconsin regional president from August 2020 through 2022. A decade before that, he lived on the western shore of Maryland as the CEO of the Maryland Pennysaver.\nIn 2010, Baez entered the news industry when he took a job with Tribune Publishing Company in Newport News, Virginia.\n\"I joined newspapers in 2010 and have been with them ever since,\" he said.\nAs regional president, Baez will oversee the Chesapeake market.\n\"I'm excited,\" he said about his new role. \"Adams is a great company. They've been really good to me.\"\nBaez — who won the first ever APG Regional President of the Year award in 2021 — said one of his favorite company memories is when the company asked him for his opinion and they supported him.\n\"And they let me go do that,\" he said. \"That speaks volumes for the kind of culture that the company has.\"\nBefore taking on the new role with APG, Baez was the CEO of TravelHost, a publication connecting businesses with travelers. He said that during his time in the news industry, he's enjoyed getting to connect businesses with audiences that desire the products and services of those businesses.\n\"That's the creative part,\" he said. \"That's the energizing part.\"\nBaez, whose family immigrated to the United States as political exiles from Cuba, said he is a big fan of free speech.\n\"From that standpoint I think journalism plays a great part,\" he said. \"I think journalism has evolved a lot, and we continue to evolve it along with what people want. I think we have to get smarter about how we write (and) what we write about because it is something that we have to eventually monetize to sustain.\"\nAPG CEO and President Mark Adams said in a news release that Baez brings \"familiarity and experience\" to this position.\n\"It's always rewarding when we can have an executive like Orestes return to our organization,\" he said.\nWhen he's not working, Baez can often be found on the pickleball courts. The three-time national champ is currently playing on the pickleball Senior Pro Tour.\nHis love for pickleball blossomed after decades of playing tennis. Since picking up a tennis racket at the age of 9, he has won over 300 tennis doubles titles. While in college, Baez played tennis for Clemson University. He also coached the Clemson team while in graduate school there.\nIt wasn't until he was in his 50s that Baez's friend convinced him to give pickleball a try. Since then, Baez has gone from playing the sport recreationally to playing in tournaments.\nAs he settles into his new role on the Chesapeake, Baez is looking for houses in Annapolis with his wife, Donna. He said he is excited to contribute to the Chesapeake team.\n\"It's about removing obstacles and helping guide,\" he said about his role. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Department of Aging funding anticipated to remain flat, secretary says\n\n January 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: General Assembly \n \n 443\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Funding for the Maryland Department of Aging is expected to remain flat over the coming year, according to Maryland Secretary of Aging Carmel Roques.The secretary's comment came after Del. Chris Adams (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) asked if there were concerns about the department's budget outcome during an Eastern Shore Delegation meeting Friday morning.\nConcerns are not with losing funding, but with an anticipated inability to grow funding.\n\"The okay news is we don't anticipate our funding to be cut, but we're not going to have additional funding,\" Roques said. \"And the way we're going to try and make that a better situation is the way we engage with, in a collaborative fashion, … our health and our housing agencies.\"\nThe majority of the department's funding comes from the federal government. State funding comprises a smaller portion of the dollars the department has to distribute.\nIn fiscal year 2024, Upper Shore Aging, the designated area agency on aging for Talbot, Caroline and Kent counties, received almost $782,000 from the state Department of Aging.\nQueen Anne's County received about $333,000, and Cecil County received roughly $554,000.\nMAC Inc., which is the area agency for Dorchester, Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester counties, received just over $1.3 million.\nKnowing the funding was unlikely to grow, the department took steps early on to maximize the funding available to direct it more effectively at the local level, Roques said.\nThose steps included working with stakeholder groups to look at three state programs — subsidized assisted living, congregate living and senior care money — to think about redesigning the long-term services and supports system in place from the state funding.\nAccording to Roques, the work being done now will not \"dramatically\" change anything about fiscal year 2025, but it will in the coming years.\nThe Administration on Community Living, a federal agency that increases access to community supports for older adults and those with disabilities, also recently changed regulations to include guidance that will impact equity, she said.\nRoques said the update to the regulations is \"good news\" for the rural elderly population, their families and care providers.\nThe state's rural communities have the highest populations of adults age 50 and older, according to data shared during her presentation.\nThe rural counties on the Eastern Shore have some of the highest numbers. In 2020, 50.8% of Talbot County's population was over age 50.\nMaryland's overall population is rapidly growing older. In the next six years, the state will see more residents over 60 than under 18 — a first, Roques said.\n\"...What's being baked into that guidance is that rural communities need to be more heavily weighted in the formula for distribution of funds to recognize that their challenges are very different,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

GEDMAN St. Luke’s GMC | Section: News \n \n 332\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Lenten season begins today, a day called Ash Wednesday.Ashes are a sign of mortality and repentance. The uses of ashes dates back to ancient Jewish tradition and often were associated with sacrifices, mourning and fasting. A person would properly express grief, humiliation and repentance sitting in ashes or placing them on the head.\nAt one time, during the early centuries of the church, public penitents at Rome were ceremonially admitted on this day to begin their penance.\nThis ceremony fell into disuse between the eighth and 10th centuries as general penance of the entire congregation began to take place. This penance was symbolized through the imposition of ashes.\nAnother use for ashes in the early church (second century) included a regular ceremony of public confession and penance. This use had acquired so much significance that Tertullian (a prolific early Christian author from Carthage in the Roman province of Africa) spoke of \"the substitution of sackcloth and ashes for a man's usual habit.\"\nToday, ashes symbolize the same meanings though the ceremonial customs have vanished. The one exception to this is Ash Wednesday.\nThe word \"Lent\" derives from the anglo-saxon term lencten, meaning \"spring.\" During this time we earnestly recount all that God accomplished through the work of Jesus Christ.\nWe experience this period every year in the life of the church, but often, we forget, or sometimes we never knew what this time of year is about. Lent as a forty-day period of focus on penitence and preparation for the Resurrection Event of Easter. Today, we tend to observe Lent as a time of penance, by abstaining from festivals, by almsgiving, and by devoting more than the usual time to exercises of the faith. In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on these aspects than the physical fasting that marked this season in the early church.\nI pray that this Lenten season would be a holy and sacred time of preparation for the celebration of the greatest day in human history; the resurrection of Jesus Christ. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Former Gov. Larry Hogan is running for the open U.S. Senate seat and stopped in Easton Friday to talk with people at the service center.He visited the facility on 126 Port Street and asked questions.\nThe Responsible Father Initiative, founded by Corey Pack and co-facilitated by Lou Dorsey, is an outreach program to help men become better fathers. It is a nonprofit and is all confidential. It provides food, clothing and first month's rent to people in need. These men gave Hogan the tour of the center.\nPack spoke to the governor about what they teach.\n\"We go over what is called the three E's. Emotion, energy and expression. And we talk about effective listening skills,\" Pack said. \"We run through the 7/38/55 rule. 7% of the way we communicate is verbally. 38% is with our tone and 55% is with our body language.\"\nThe governor listened closely.\n\"I did not realize that,\" Hogan said. \"That is an important lesson for me to learn.\"\nHe listened to more about the program.\n\"We try to develop more nurturing and caring fathers in this program. Most of the guys grew up in a home without a father. Some have been incarcerated with no contact with their children. It is great for them to see their children and establish a relationship with their children,\" Dorsey said.\nHogan recognized that a lot of men needed these services and saluted their dedication to helping these men flourish.\n\"It sounds like you guys are doing really important work here,\" Hogan said.\nOne of the Neighborhood Service Center workers asked Hogan to run for president. He smiled.\nHogan toured spaces intended for children. Then he went into the kitchen and in another room saw where they store clothes to give away.\nAt the end of tour, he was give two T-shirts and a coffee mug that touted the Neighborhood Service Center.\nAfter his visit he stopped to do an interview in the parking lot. Hogan said his campaign is focused on the economy and crime.\n\"We are meeting voters every day,\" he said. \"The people of Maryland know me after eight years of being governor.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The gentleman knew me by my nickname, and I quickly became a good listener. Trying to place the voice it took me a few minutes to realize who it was a long-time multigenerational family friend. Let's call him Mike. I would later reflect on what an honor it was for me.For the better part of an hour, he regaled me with stories of yesteryear (none, surprisingly, set in the famed bygone watering hole of that name), featuring my father, grandfather and great-grandfather. My eyes swelled as he began to bring the good old days back to life, first in black and white, then in color. Some stories I had had a taste of, but most were new to me. What gentlemen they were.\nI share that story to preface this one. While enjoying the company of \"The Thursday Brotherhood\" the topic of today's social climate came up. All of our comments were true and valid in their own way; I can only imagine that each generation feels the same, that in any moment in history, there are good times and not-so-good times.\nThe conversation brought back memories of my great-grandfather Walter Wood; he was the chief of police for then little old Easton. He called it \"my town,\" and used his platform to serve with understanding as only he could. One quality of old Walter I heard about more than a few times was his sensible approach to life. My dad called it his C.S. (common sense) degree.\nAs it goes, he would leave home after supper, head to the firehouse, and open the door to the locals who needed shelter for the night. Today, we call them homeless. He would lock the door and call it a night. In the morning, the routine played out in reverse. What a novel solution.\nToday, we share the same challenges as our predecessors, updated for the 21st century. How we approach them and resolve them is up to us, let's call it perspective. Sometimes what is old is what's new again. Having a bit more compassion and understanding for our neighbors can't be all wrong. Just maybe if we all use our C.S. degrees a bit more, we can all wake up and go to sleep with a smile.\nROO WOOD\nWittman \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Peter & Paul head coach Debbie McQuaid said after the Sabres improved to 10-2 with their fourth straight victory, the last three by shutout.Webb gained possession of the ball from about 25 yards away from Easton's cage near the 4-minute mark of the first period. She circled left, then moved right before unloading a hard drive from the left side that got past Warrior goalie Alli Newman before banging into the far right corner of the cage.\"My teammates basically helped us all get up the field,\" Webb said. \"I just took it and I don't know what really happened.I was just really determined to get that goal. I knew I had to get off a shot real quickly. I just hit it and it went in. I was really shocked.\" Easton (5-4) earned two of its nine penalty corners in the final 1:15 of the first quarter, getting one shot off that was wide of the mark. Both teams each picked up one corner in the second quarter, but could not capitalize.The game remained even through the third, as the Warriors picked up three more corners, with Easton's Bis Johnson firing wide left.Sts. Peter & Paul had one corner in the third, with Gennie Webb shooting wide right.\"They came out and they scored on us, and it was a beautiful goal,\" said Easton head coach Kim Neff, whose team lost its second straight by shutout. \"I do feel like the rest of the game we picked up our pace, we had good passing.I felt like our defense and middies played a really great game.\"They just struck first and we just couldn't capitalize on our opportunities,\" Neff continued.\"We had plenty of corners. We had plenty of shots. We just couldn't put it in today.\" The Sabres earned their fourth and final corner with 11 minutes remaining but didn't managed anything on goal. Easton had two more corner chances, the last with a minute remaining but could not get the equalizer.\"We really had the determination to win,\" Sts. Peter & Paul's Jules Stepp said. \"They're our friends, and even though they're our friends, we like to have our friendly competition with them.\"I really think we communicated well and we looked up and we passed to each other,\" Stepp continued. \"And we played a little bit of short and long ball together. And our defense, every time they got the opportunity to get the ball they cleared it out to the side and they recovered. They were on their 'A' game today.\" But McQuaid thought it took a little while for that 'A' game to materialize.\"Defense held solid,\" said McQuaid after goalie Maddie Maloney and company registered their sixth shutout of the season. \"They were a little befuddled in the first half and not marking the way they were supposed to.

Across from the entrance to the complex is an open field about the size of a football field.For most of the years that we have lived here that field was left in its natural state. That meant lots of wild flowers (chicory, daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne's lace, Joe Pye, milkweed, etc.).Also birds were among the inhabitants, especially redwing blackbirds, as well as many butterflies (swallowtails, monarchs, buckeyes, fritillaries, cabbage whites, blues, morning cloaks).Now twice a year it is mowed down to an ugly field of clumps of vegetation.And why? So I can see the bypass.To destroy such a natural magnet for native flowers, butterflies and birds makes a mockery of leadership that professes to care about the environment.My question is: What government agencies make this decision - town, county or state? I want the responsible government entity to be aware of the unhappiness that this brutal treatment of a formerly beautiful field has caused.JAMES CARROLL Easton \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

That could be enough money to keep captain and face of the franchise Steven Stamkos or make a significant free agent signing, and it will go a long way to providing room to lock up cornerstone defenseman Victor Hedman with a long-term contract extension.\nThe Lightning got younger on the blue line by receiving 24-year-old defenseman J.J. Moser, along with forward prospect Conor Geekie and two draft picks for Sergachev, who was signed through 2031 making $8.5 million annually. A 2025 second-rounder and a fourth this year allows Tampa Bay to restock its prospect pool after making eight consecutive playoff appearances, winning two titles and reaching the final three times.\nThat contending window remains wide open, and general manage Julien BriseBois now has flexibility to retool on the fly with free agency opening Monday. Stamkos staying is a possibility, and now the Lightning have the opportunity to pursue one or more of the top wingers available, a group that includes Jake Guentzel, Patrick Kane and Jonathan Marchessault.\nThe Capitals already did their big-name hunting last week by acquiring highly paid center Pierre-Luc Dubois from the Kings for goaltender Darcy Kuemper. On Saturday, they filled that void in net by acquiring Logan Thompson from host Vegas for a pair of third-round picks.\nThompson figures to split time with Charlie Lindgren in a tandem costing less than $2 million total next season, with a year left on each goalie's contract. Thompson, 27, was an All-Star and played 37 games for the Golden Knights during their 2022-23 championship run before getting injured before the playoffs.\n\"I got a lot more that I can prove in this league and I'm hoping that I get that opportunity with Washington,\" said Thompson, who was in bed when he was informed of the trade and hurried to the Sphere for a previously scheduled autograph signing. \"Actually, it was a good alarm clock. I woke up to that and then obviously get ready and come down, and I knew it was going to be an interesting day.\"\nLong before getting his name engraved on the Stanley Cup, Thompson got his first foray into the NHL Capitals development camp in the summer of 2018. He played for Washington at back-to-back prospect showcases, went to training camp with the American Hockey League's Hershey Bears in 2019, starred for the ECHL's South Carolina and earned his first contract as a result.\n\"I'm thankful for the Washington goalie department every day,\" Thompson told The Associated Press at 2023 All-Star Weekend. \"They're the reason why I'm here. They're the only team that gave me a chance three years ago. If it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be here today.\"\nWashington also traded fourth-line winger Beck Malenstyn to Buffalo for the 43rd pick, taking U.S.-born defenseman Cole Hutson, and traded up in the third round to select Ilya Protas, the younger brother of Capitals forward Aliaksei Protas. Malenstyn, 26, is a restricted free agent with arbitration rights who had 21 points in 81 games during his first full NHL season and gives the Sabres Buffalo valuable forward depth as they try to end the league's longest playoff drought.\nLooking to end the longest Stanley Cup drought, the Toronto Maple Leafs took a step toward upgrading their defense by acquiring the rights to pending free agent Chris Tanev from Dallas for a 2026 seventh-round pick. The trade gives Toronto the first crack at signing the valuable 24-year-old top-four defenseman.\nVegas moved quickly to replenish goalie depth by acquiring Akira Schmid from New Jersey along with young forward Alexander Holtz in a trade that sent Paul Cotter and a third-rounder to the Devils. Among the other moves, St. Louis traded Kevin Hayes and a '25 second-rounder to Pittsburgh for future considerations to shed the remainder of the his contract, and Boston sent Jakob Lauko to Minnesota for Vinni Lettieri in a swap of centers that also involved draft picks.\nThe Sabres after getting Malenstyn began the process of buying out the contract of forward Jeff Skinner, GM Kevyn Adams confirmed at the conclusion of the draft. The buyout saves Buffalo $7.5 million next season while spreading out money owed to Skinner against the cap through 2030. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Planners not sold on 365-unit development near new Easton hospital\n\n June 26, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 739\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — An application for a 365-unit residential development near the in-construction regional medical center in Easton has been submitted to the town's Planning Commission for review, though it's drawing criticism from some town and county officials.The project, Fox Chase Estates, is proposed on 112 acres of land off of Airport Road nestled within the Easton Technology Center. Developers are seeking town approval through Easton's planned unit development process, which would allow the homes to be built on the commercial-zoned land.\nThe developers are Easton Sunrise Partners LLC and Scott Wagner, a Talbot County businessman and a former Republican member of the Pennsylvania State Senate. They previously aimed to build warehouses on the site, but in recent years plans shifted to residential — an effort that Shore Regional Health President and CEO Ken Kozel supports, according to Wagner's attorney, Lawrence Scott.\n\"We are trying to build a residential community that meets the need of the hospital,\" Scott said Tuesday, noting that Wagner and Kozel have met to discuss the project.\nIn a statement Wednesday, Kozel said affordable housing availability is \"essential\" to recruit and retain health care workers in a rural community like Easton. The hospital is not legally or financially involved with the proposed development, Scott said.\nAt an hours long meeting Tuesday, Planning Commission members were nowhere near ready to provide a positive recommendation on the proposal.\n\"It feels like we're being the Planning Commission for the hospital and not for the town,\" said member William Ryall. \"And that gives me a lot of concern.\"\nVictoria McAndrews said the plans are \"overwhelmingly suburban.\" Michael Ports, the commission's vice chair, said a lack of connectivity from the proposed development — which sits at the northernmost part of town limits — to Easton's core is a \"non-starter.\"\nPhilip Toussaint, commission chair, said parts of the plan significantly fall short of meeting Easton's comprehensive plan, which sets the framework for how the town facilitates growth. That comprehensive plan is undergoing an update currently, and McAndrews said such a large project should wait for that update.\nScott said Tuesday that developers have met individually with Town Council members and Mayor Megan Cook multiple times and that the 365-unit project meets affordable housing needs that the town and its residents are asking for.\nTHE UNITS\nApplication documents show that developers are planning for a variety of units, including single-family homes, three-story townhomes and multifamily buildings, along with two commercial buildings.\nThe 365 units are broken down as follows: 108 single-family detached homes, 137 three-story townhomes and 120 multifamily units, the latter of which are contained in four four-story buildings.\nThe density is well below the maximum permitted by the town's planned unit development standards. According to developers, 185 of the 365 units would be affordably priced.\n\"We're doing that without even the statutory forcing of us to do it,\" Scott said, adding that developers have a \"bidding war\" from home building companies to take on the project. \"The market is working on its own.\"\nAPPROVAL PROCESS\nFox Chase Estates still has a handful of steps before it is approved by Easton officials. With significant pushback already, it's likely to be a lengthy process.\nIn staff analysis of the application, concerns were raised about the site plan, which only includes one main vehicle access point to the 365-unit development. An emergency exit stretching west to Goldsborough Neck Road did not satisfy town staff. Scott said developers would prefer not to add that as a main access point but will consider it.\n\"We really want two access points to any project like this,\" said Town Engineer Rick Van Emburgh.\nTalbot County Engineer Ray Clarke criticized the project and the lack of communication between developers and the county. Clarke said it'll put an undue stress on Airport and Goldsborough Neck Roads and added concerns that the homes will be in the runway protection zone for Easton Airport.\n\"We need to be very, very careful when we're looking at these types of development,\" Clarke said. \"This was general commercial as originally planned. We were told three or four years ago it was going to be warehouses.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Planning Commission opted to place a pin in the matter and revisit it on July 17. Commission members may then provide a recommendation.\nOnce the commission makes its recommendation, council members will consider the application and hold a public hearing before any decision. While the council may take the commission's decision into account, the five council members have the final say, with a majority required for approval. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But I do feel the need to respond when a writer gets published with no good reasoning. Such is the case with Mr. Adrian's letter \"Gone down a dark road,\" in Sunday's 14 January edition.\nHis letter is filled with false statements. For example, he claims that Democrats control elections to push some kind of agenda. There is no evidence for that. Quite the contrary. Mr. Adrian somehow completely missed the well-known information that Republicans are involved in managing elections. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of examples.\nEven the head Republican, Donald Trump, knew that when he called the Republicans who control elections asking them to alter votes in 2020. As another example, Mr. Adrian seems to claim that harvesting crops in the fall leads to harvesting ballots. I don't think there is any evidence for that.\nBut what really gets me is the use of questions for arguments. This illogical method of argument is a tool of conspiracy theorists and despots for thousands of years. \"When did you stop beating your spouse?\" is the classic retort to that entire form of reasoning.\nMr. Adrian received a document about mail-in ballots and points out he could print it. \"What could possibly go wrong?\" he writes as if that question is a legitimate argument against the entire process. Without evidence, the question makes no sense, any more than me asking Mr. Adrian when he stopped beating people. Mr. Adrian should read about how the Arizona Republican Party spent millions of tax dollars on a month's-long audit of ballots that only showed Mr. Biden's votes were undercounted. Georgia audited their elections three times by hand counting ballots and found no fraud. These are just two facts out of hundreds of examples that belie the assumption underlying Mr. Adrian's question.\nMr. Adrian poses many other questions that assume evidence where none exists. And he ends his letter with the question, \"Which political party controls the Board of Elections anyway?\" as if that is a reason for everyone to doubt elections. It is not.\nAll available evidence is that elections in Maryland are fair and honest. People should appreciate that and take the time to vote.\nMICHAEL DAVIS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Chad Hill, the company's vice president, said the 82-room hotel stands out in more ways than one.\n\"This is not a prototypical Fairfield hotel,\" Hill said. He emphasized its cleanliness, customer service and customized designs that give the hotel a small-town, Eastern Shore feel.\nEvery year, Hill said Marriott checks into each hotel for a random inspection. Marriott assesses each hotel based on a set of standards, while separately soliciting feedback from recent guests. Based on these evaluations and guest review scores, a small percentage of hotels receive the Diamond Award, a recognition from Marriott of the highest performing tier of Fairfield hotels.\nOf the 1,118 hotels evaluated, the Easton Fairfield Inn & Suites was rated fourth in intent to recommend, fifth in staff service and seventh in cleanliness.\nThe Easton Fairfield was recognized with the 2023 Diamond Award, marking its second consecutive year and third since opening in 2015. However, this year, the hotel went a step further when Marriott recognized it as Hotel of the Year within the Fairfield brand.\nAccording to Cristina Shockley, Hill Hospitality's director of operations, the Easton hotel is a popular destination for corporate stays and those in town for weddings.\nShockley added that many of the employees are familiar with the Eastern Shore and its history and charm, a benefit for guests that are visiting for the first time. Some team members have been at the hotel since it opened, she said.\n\"We're so fortunate to have an incredible team,\" Hill said of the team that hovers around 23 employees.\nSince the hospitality group is based in Easton, Hill said it's special to have the hometown property recognized at such a high level. Hill Hospitality manages six hotels, two each in Maryland and South Carolina, and one each in Maine and New York. Two additional hotels are in the works, including one in Fruitland that will open in June 2025.\n\"Every guest is given the opportunity to enjoy the charming small-town atmosphere that the Easton team provides when staying at our hotel,\" Shockley said in a written statement. \"The Hotel of the Year award is a testament to the team's unwavering commitment to give the ultimate in guest service. When walking through the front door, the hotel has a feeling of timelessness and added pride that distinguishes it from other Fairfields in the brand.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Herzog Foundation.The Herzog Foundation is a national organization dedicated to \"advancing Christian education.\" The foundation enriches Christian (K-12) education by creating and leading various programs.\nOne of these programs was the 2023 Bill of Rights Essay Contest. All middle and high school students enrolled in a Christian school or those homeschooled in the U.S. were eligible to participate. Winners were selected from one middle school and one high school. Each winner would go on to receive $250 from the Herzog Foundation. The winners' schools also received an additional $250.\nParticipants were asked to answer these questions in three pages or less, \"What made the Bill of Rights so revolutionary and unique when it was ratified? How has the Bill of Rights shaped our country?\"\nIn an excerpt from Viana's eloquently crafted three-page essay, the middle school winner wrote, \"The Bill of Rights is famous for that little, life-changing word: freedom, but what most people don't realize is that these documents weren't written overnight. Real people struggled, wrestled, and mulled over each word and phrase that went into the Bill of Rights, until it was finally ratified on December 15, 1791. Not only was it composed through much time and consideration but it secured the rights of people today granting our blessed country to grow, expand, and enter new times of innovation. It summarized what we stood for then and stand for now. It lets a person breathe, work, and earn their way to success.\"\nThe Herzog Foundation announced Viana, daughter of George and Cathy Johnston, as the middle school winner of the contest in December. Johnston received the prize money and a trophy for her achievement.\nIn a release announcing the winners, Herzog Foundation Chairman Todd Graves said, \"The Bill of Rights was ratified over 230 years ago and still stands as a beacon for our most fundamental rights as Americans. It's crucial that all young students understand the significance of this founding document.\"\nKathy Guerra, head of Lighthouse Christian Academy, stated the school was initially in disbelief, as this was the first time their school had made an entry to a contest of this magnitude. However, they were not surprised that Viana had won, as she is a gifted writer who creates masterworks of art with her words. \"Viana is an inquisitive, energetic, and ambitious student,\" says Guerra, who \"seeks to excel in all of her subjects.\"\nTo learn more about the Herzog Foundation and the programs it has to offer, visit www.herzog foundation.com. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Typically, you are looking at people who have previously voted, who are kind in that soft middle,\" said Waite, who has mostly worked on Republican campaigns.\nWaite said while social media can help engage more voters and could help engage nonvoters, especially young ones, the medium presents challenges.\n\"You are competing with everything else. The slice of time you get in front of them is very very small,\" he said of the social media content streams.\nNegative campaigning, coarse social discourse and misinformation on key issues have also magnified on social media leaving voters and nonvoters distrustful of content and disparate and sometimes ideological information sources.\n\"It's hard for average voters to figure out what's going on,\" said Waite.\nIn an Aug. 26 letter to the House Judiciary Committee, META Platforms chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the Biden-Harris administration \"repeatedly pressured\" Facebook and Instagram to censor dissenting content (including humor and satire) related to COVID-19.\nThe White House defended those actions as helping protect public health from misinformation.\nRecent surveys show low levels of trust in politics, the media and government, as well as plenty of economic stress stemming from the post-pandemic inflation wave.\nA June survey by financial firm Credit Karma and research firm Qualtrics found 68% of Americans don't believe official economic data touting job gains and easing inflation after post-pandemic spikes in prices.\nAnother recent poll by Gallup and the Walton Foundation shows Gen Zers (ages 12 to 27) have little trust in the media, government and politics. But they showed strong turnout in 2020 and are expected to also show up in November, said Craig Snyder, campaign director for Haley Voters for Harris (a group that hopes to get GOP supporters of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to eschew Trump).\nNEW ENERGY?Snyder said Harris' campaign should energize younger voters more than the matchup between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\"They weren't excited about a race between two 80-year-old men,\" said Snyder, noting that Democratic enthusiasm for Harris will also generate GOP energy for Trump.\nHarris was installed at the top of the Democratic ticket after Biden, 81, was pressured to quit the race by donors and party power players over concerns about his age.\nSnyder said voting groups such as suburban women, Black and Hispanic men, along with voters on both sides of Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas could tip the race in battlegrounds such as Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s endorsement of Trump could also shift his voters, many of whom are disaffected by COVID policies (including vaccines), in key states.\nSnyder also sees another contingent of nonvoters beyond the disaffected and those with logistical barriers.\n\"There's a third group,\" he said. \"They just don't connect politics to their lives.\"\nGOTV EFFORTSPolitical organizations on both sides do have get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts across the country, including some aimed at first-time and nonvoters.\nConservative groups — such as Christians United for Israel — hope to turn out evangelicals for Trump and Republicans. That includes working with churches across the country on support for Israel and voter mobilization.\nDemocrats look to college campuses, as well as Native Americans, Blacks and Hispanics in key races.\nIn Montana, Nick Marroletti, coordinated campaign director for the state Democratic Party, said grassroots turn-out efforts have included knocking on 100,000 doors and making 97,000 phone calls supporting U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, who faces a tough challenge from Republican Tim Sheehy.\n'LACK OF FAITH'Mara Ostfeld, a research scientist at the University of Michigan, analyzed voting sentiments in Detroit and found Latino voters, in particular, have lower turnout propensities.\nOstfeld agrees that nonvoters, especially lower-income ones, don't see the outcome of elections impacting their daily lives.\n\"There is a disconnect,\" Ostfeld said. But she also said that doesn't mean nonvoters are not engaged or connected to their communities in other ways and don't follow politics.\n\"It's not like they are disinterested or disengaged,\" Ostfeld said. \"There is just a lack of faith in the political system in particular.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Robert Wise directed the 1979 film; several of the movie sequels follow.\n\"The 25th Annual A Home for the Holidays\" (CBS, Friday, Dec. 22): Though this is a new special, it's also classic in a way, since it's the latest edition of a seasonal franchise that has advocated for adoption and moved audiences for a quarter-century. Celebrities - including Katharine McPhee (this year's host), Pentatonix, CeCe Winans and Gavin DeGraw - perform and offer true stories of youngsters who have found homes with loving families who have brought them in, and a box of tissues is a virtual requirement for watching the traditionally heartwarming program. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Lakeside wastewater treatment plant is complete\n\n June 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 1257\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TRAPPE — The Lakeside wastewater treatment plant is built, running and ready for the next step in the Lakeside development plan, which is transferring ownership to the town of Trappe.Two Lakeside transfer agreements were presented during a recent Trappe Council meeting. These agreements are the first steps in eventually passing over ownership of the wastewater treatment plant to the Town of Trappe.\nThis controversial project has faced lawsuits, petitions and an array of public outcry over environmental concerns, but it is an essential step in moving forward with the Lakeside development.\nFirst proposed over 20 years ago, the planned 2,501-unit Lakeside at Trappe development spans more than 850 acres off of U.S. Route 50. The development is slated to include a mix of single-family homes, townhouses and apartments, and commercial and retail spaces.\nTrappe's existing plant has the capacity to take on wastewater from the development's first 120 homes. That flow will eventually be diverted to the new wastewater treatment plant serving the development, a plan approved by county legislation and via an MDE wastewater discharge permit.\nSpray irrigation systemThe new plant, set with enriched nutrient removal technology, uses a spray irrigation system to discharge treated wastewater onto nearby fields.\nAccording to the Pennsylvania Water Science Center, the sprayed wastewater either evaporates into the air, soaks into the soil or percolates through the soil and recharges the groundwater.\nRobert Rauch, president of Rauch Inc., a project management and civil engineering firm for Lakeside, said spray irrigation has been recognized for years by states and the federal government as a preferred method of treated wastewater disposal.\n\"It is an exceptional re-use method of disposal that recharges groundwater and can provide needed nutrients to agricultural ground covers,\" he said. \"Generally, spray irrigation does not require the highest levels of treatment, so valuable nutrients are available for plants to reduce farmers' costs for additional commercial fertilizer.\"\nRaunch said this is based on Lakeside's developer's voluntary election to provide enhanced nutrient removal level treatment to avoid groundwater nutrient increases. The MDE discharge permit establishes strict limitations on the discharge of treated wastewater, which results in the application of a fraction of the nutrient uptake requirements of the grass planted in the irrigation field.\nRaunch said that due to the high quality of the Lakeside wastewater effluent and the nutrient needs of the ground cover, there is no practical scenario in which the spray irrigation of treated effluent will negatively impact surface or groundwater.\n\"Ironically, the nutrient levels of the treated effluent will be so low that the farmer will have to apply fertilizer to the spray irrigation field to maintain a vigorous and healthy crop cover,\" he said.\nAlan Girard, advocacy director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, argued that nutrients absorbed into groundwater could eventually discharge into nearby impaired rivers and streams like the Choptank River.\n\"I don't think people understand that the state is claiming that there will be zero discharge of nutrients to groundwater,\" Girard said. \"The state has already demonstrated that there's a link between groundwater and surface water and surface letters that are tarred right near the discharge. So the state needs to be accountable for that issue.\"\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation and ShoreRivers filed separate petitions for judicial review of the permit in, citing concerns about the spray irrigation of treated wastewater and specifics of a nutrient management plan not being made available during the permit's public comment period in 2020.\nMatt Pluta, Choptank riverkeeper and director of riverkeeper programs for ShoreRivers, said that the wastewater issue has been a concern for ShoreRivers due to the existing Trappe plant and how poorly it has been functioning and treating the wastewater before discharging it into Trappe Creek.\nAccording to Pluta, the Lakeside Plant is making noticeable improvements that were not seen in the old Trappe Wastewater Plant.\n\"I'll go on and say that one thing that's very clear and obvious is that there will be more treatment from this new plant,\" Pluta said. \"The wastewater will be treated to a cleaner standard. That's what we want to see. We support that. The thing that concerns us with the new plan is just the method of discharge. That's where they'll be spraying the treated wastewater onto nearby farm fields.\"\nPluta said the way the state permits spraying the treated wastewater onto nearby farm fields is under what he calls \"legal fiction or false assumptions.\" When someone is spraying wastewater on a farm field, that wastewater gets taken up by the plants.\nThrough studying agricultural practices, Pluta has learned of the impacts of runoff and pollution on groundwater. He said there are different incentives for someone operating a wastewater treatment plant compared to farmers caring for local crops.\nPluta stated that no farmer is applying nutrients to their crops every day throughout the whole growing season. There is an incentive for wastewater treatment operators to focus on controlling their volume and not so much on a healthy crop, which Pluta said is concerning for the sake of adding too much pollution to these fields.\nEach farm that receives spraying from the plant needs a nutrient management plan on how many nutrients can be put on the fields. Those plans were not public information, but because it was part of the treatment process, ShoreRiver argued to make that information public.\nIt was through the 2020 filed lawsuit that the permit was remanded to the Maryland Department of the Environment, which issued a new permit with fewer homes and less wastewater.\nA separate lawsuit was filed against MDE by concerned residents in May 2022 asking to revoke the permit and suspend any work with a sewage system as inconsistent with the county's comprehensive plan. Though the suits was ultimately dismissed last June, MDE issued a revised discharge permit for Lakeside, approving a significantly smaller wastewater treatment plant.\nThe revised permit allows for an average flow of 100,000 gallons per day. A vast decrease from the 540,000 gallons per day initially requested by the developer.\nOversightIn part due to the outcry and lawsuits made by residents and environmental organizations, a wave of resolutions were brought forward to better address concerns involving the Wastewater Treatment Plant.\nOne that stood out to many was Resolution 338, which amended Talbot County's Comprehensive Water and Sewer Plan. It requires an amendment to the comprehensive plan for any future expansion of the new Lakeside wastewater treatment plant.\nThough this was deemed favorable to the environmental organizations, there were many, including members of Trappe's council, that opposed the Lakeside resolutions.\nDuring a public hearing before the vote of Resolution 338, Brian Schmidt, Trappe Town Council president, commented opposing the resolution and stated that the county was treating Trappe differently than other towns, hurting the municipality's growth.\n\"We did not ask this council to intervene,\" Schmidt said. \"MDE is the controlling authority in matters of wastewater discharge, not the county. Disguising growth legislation as wastewater discharge is not proper procedure is only impeding the town's authority to control its own growth.\"\nNext stepsDuring the June 5 Trappe Town Council meeting, two Lakeside transfer agreements were presented. These agreements are the first steps in eventually passing over ownership of the wastewater treatment plant to the Town of Trappe.\nAccording to Showalter, Once the initial phase of the wastewater treatment plant is complete and turned over to the town, the developer remains responsible for any deficiencies between the costs of operation and maintenance and the sewer revenues collected by the Town from Lakeside residents. Additionally, the developer remains responsible for the incremental expansion of the wastewater treatment plant as the capacity is utilized.\nFurther discussion on the transfer agreements will be discussed and reviewed during the Town Council's next executive session. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "As avian flu spreads, local businesses grapple with increased egg costs\n\n February 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 460\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Steve Mangasarian's is paying double what he used to for wholesale eggs.He says the price has been rising steadily since the pandemic. The recent spread of avian influenza virus, or avian flu, is accelerating that trend.\nMangasarian, the owner and chef of Breakfast in Easton, buys eggs from a vendor that sources locally. Due to the avian flu threatening poultry flocks nationwide, egg shortages are impacting businesses.\n\"The entire supply, nationwide supply, has been curtailed because of this. There's a shortage, even though I'm using local, fresh eggs,\" Mangasarian said. \"Everybody's getting squeezed.\"\nMangasarian, like some other business owners, has been forced to raise prices. At Breakfast in Easton, he's added a 50-cent surcharge to an order of eggs and a 75-cent surcharge to an order of pancakes.\n\"It is my intention to make this temporary,\" signs in the restaurant read.\nAvian flu outbreaks across the nation have afflicted egg supply, with the worst impacts felt in western and midwestern states. But local flocks have been affected as well.\nPer the Maryland Department of Agriculture, five commercial poultry farms on the Eastern Shore have experienced outbreaks, including three just last month. Several other cases were reported in Delaware.\nThe virus can spread easily between flocks, though the risk for bird-to-human transmission is low at present.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average cost for a dozen eggs was $4.15 at the end of 2024. One year earlier, the average cost was $2.51.\nThe current mark is nearing record costs seen during the avian flu outbreak in 2022. And U.S. Department of Agriculture projections predict a 20% increase in egg prices for 2025.\nFor Mangasarian, the sharp rise in egg prices has been a significant challenge. In past years, lower egg wholesale prices helped him \"subsidize\" a low return on bacon. That's flipped, however, as his returns on bacon now make up for tight egg returns.\nAt the Easton Diner on U.S. Route 50, manager Tiff Haddaway says it costs around $1,000 more per week to purchase eggs due to the recent shortage and wholesale prices. As of now, customers aren't seeing an upcharge.\n\"The owner is trying to not pass it onto the customer,\" Haddaway said.\nSteve Andrews, owner of the Bagery, says customers aren't experiencing any increases since the business' local, free-range producer hasn't been hit by the avian flu.\nAndrews, a backyard chicken flock owner for more than 15 years, did note that egg production costs have risen in past years due to increasing feed prices.\n\"We foresee that all producers, which get their day-old chicks from just a handful of operations, will all be increasing their demand to replace the culled flocks,\" Andrews wrote. \"If any of the hatcheries themselves have an outbreak, this could indicate that egg prices have not peaked and could rise even further.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One-oh. Got the result,\" Brice said after Rodrigo Fresco's goal in the fifth minute Wednesday night proved enough for a 1-0 Easton victory over the Saints.\nAnd though St. Michaels suffered its fourth loss in five games, Saints head coach Pat Hambleton may have gotten something he was looking for as well — momentum.\n\"We've had a hard stretch,\" Hambleton said after his team's third one-goal loss in 10 days, which included a 3-2 double-overtime defeat to two-time defending North Bayside champion Queen Anne's County. \"I asked them, 'Just give us momentum. Create momentum so we can move forward. Win, lose, draw, figure out a way to play well. Work hard. Find something to carry on for tomorrow (a 9-0 victory Thursday over Cambridge-South Dorchester) and then carry on into the playoffs.'\"\nThe Saints (6-4-1 overall, 2-4-1 North Bayside) may have found that momentum, playing the game's last 35 minutes, 54 seconds a man down after one of its players received a red card while an Easton player was given a yellow.\n\"I thought down (to) 10 men, I felt like we had the upper hand, and I felt like we were the man up,\" said Hambleton, who argued Easton should have also received a red.\n\"Couldn't be more proud,\" Hambleton added of his team. \"We took them out of their game. They were sitting six guys in the back for the last 20 minutes terrified of our attack and our pressure. And I thought the second half was a completely different game than the first half.\"\nWith 4:28 elapsed in the first half, Fresco got a ball on the right side and parked it past Saints keeper Lucas Greenwood for the game's lone goal and a 1-0 Warrior lead.\nThe remainder of the game featured a string of highlight-reel saves by Greenwood (10 saves) and Easton goalie Sam Hutchison (eight saves).\nGreenwood leaped to punch a ball away with 26:10 remaining in the first half. Hutchison stopped St. Michaels' Abel Delgaudio just 50 seconds later. Greenwood lunged left to foil Luke Stanco a little over 5 minutes later. St. Michaels' Connor Wheeler then struck a direct kick that Hutchison reached before colliding with Delgaudio. Greenwood made another stop a moment later, and Hutchsion responded with another save before a second collision 5 minutes later, leaving Brice pleading with his team, \"You need to wake up.\"\nThe game was mostly played between the 18s in the second half, though both keepers continued to come up big. Easton had a chance to pad its lead 9 minutes into the half, but Emmet Fox drove a shot off the left post. Hutchison picked up another save, when he knocked away a ball on a Saints corner. Greenwood maintained the one-goal difference, smothering a ball off a wild scramble with an Easton player leaping over him.\n\"We just need to be consistent in the back and then take care of the ball a little bit better,\" said Brice, his team 6-5, 6-2 after its fourth win in five games.\nFor Hambleton, it was a familiar theme.\n\"The story of the second half of our season is we're winning games off the scoreboard,\" Hambleton said. \"And that doesn't count.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I trust your recess was restful. Unfortunately, it was also silent. You chose not to hold a town hall meeting during your time in the district. That absence did not go unnoticed. It deprived your constituents of the chance to hear you explain why you reversed yourself on the spending bill you had so fiercely opposed — until you suddenly didn't. You claimed \"assurances\" persuaded you. Assurances of what, exactly? Your vote helped push through the single largest increase in the federal deficit in history. If you stand by that decision, you should have had the courage to face us and defend it.But my main concern today is not the budget, it is the Jeffrey Epstein files. You are a Catholic. You are a father of daughters. Given both, it should not require any moral calculus to condemn not only Epstein, but also anyone who willingly associated with him while he and his circle exploited, abused, and demeaned young women. The conduct in question — sexual assault, abuse of minors, harassment in dressing rooms, grotesque violations of trust — is abhorrent. And participation in, or willful blindness to, these acts is unforgivable.\nYour colleagues in Congress are circulating a bipartisan discharge petition demanding the release of all Epstein files. This is a defining moment for you. Will you align yourself with justice and transparency, or will you shield predators and the powerful? As a father, you owe this to every parent whose child was harmed. As a man of faith, you owe it to your conscience. As my representative, you owe it to me.\nSo let me be clear: I expect you to sign this petition. I demand that you sign it. Your record of retreat and equivocation has already earned you the nickname \"nowhere man.\" If you fail to step up here, it will confirm that title — and worse, it will mark you as someone who turned away from the helpless in their moment of need.\nThe victims deserve closure. The public deserves the truth. The perpetrators deserve justice. Representative Harris, history will remember whether you stood tall or disappeared. Choose wisely.\nDAN McKEW\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Instead, they focus instead on fund raising, collecting dues, marketing services, lobbying and sending periodic news updates to their members.\nPutnam also drew a distinction between two different but equally important types of social capital.\nOne type is \"bonding\" which occurs within a homogenous demographic group.\nThe other type is \"bridging\" which unites people from different groups.\nPutnam concluded a lack of social capital undermines the active civic engagement that a strong democracy requires from its citizens.\nI now know my friend's visit was more than a get-together to talk over old times, catch up on current times and ponder on the future.\nIn all our discussions, including those with civil discourse on politics, we built social capital.\nIt was unexpected opportunity to think about and evaluate what I can be and should be doing to help address the lack of civil discourse and to help increase social capital in our society.\nThe answer is clear.\nGoing forward, I must consistently strive to:\nRespectively consider all points of view.Listen with more than waiting for my turn to talk.Say regularly \"you may be right.\"Limit discussions as debates.Disagree without being disagreeable.Always look for opportunities to build social capital. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Sheriff's deputies' pay is competitive and sheriff's deputies now are on the state-sponsored LEOPS retirement program, allowing them to retire after 25 years. These benefits, in conjunction with solid leadership, means the Sheriff's Office can fill open positions. Deputies now retire from the department – a once-rare circumstance – rather than leaving to work in other jurisdictions.\nLikewise, our Emergency Services compensation has increased.\nPay for paramedics, emergency medical technicians and 911 dispatchers is more competitive than in 2020 — though we need to monitor this against surrounding counties, and paramedics are now eligible for the LEOPS retirement program, a popular benefit. The county has stepped its sixth advanced life aupport ambulance crew to a seven-day, round-the-clock unit, helping us keep response times within the critical 8-minute standard.\nThe county is planning a new ambulance station near the Chapel District Elementary School, which will help reduce response times in the northeast corner of Talbot County, where we have struggled to meet the 8-minute standard.\nOur County Detention Center has faced staffing shortages, forcing mandatory overtime to operate the facility safely. The County has responded by boosting correctional officer salaries and budgeted to convert their retirement plan to the more robust state-sponsored CORS program.\nThe state of Maryland mandates what we spend on our court system and the minimum that we must spend on public schools. While the state allows the county to exceed its property tax cap to fund schools, there is no state mandate to fund the sheriff's department or ambulance services or road repairs. And so these critical county services may suffer if the property tax cap restricts revenues and forces cuts.\nAll of the funds raised by the \"extra penny\" on the property tax since 2022 — and more — has gone to boosting public safety. The \"extra penny\" runs out in 2026. The Talbot County Council unanimously authorized a ballot question to renew the \"extra penny\" for seven more years, out of concern public safety costs will continue to rise faster than the 2% property tax cap.\nVoting for Question A allows the County Council the option to levy the \"extra penny\" for seven more years — through fiscal year 2033. Even with this \"extra penny,\" over the last four years or for the next seven years, Talbot County maintains the lowest property tax rate in the state of Maryland.\nIf you support public safety and emergency services, vote for Question A. Do it for your family's safety. Do it for your neighbors. Do it for your own good. Vote for Question A. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — The summer tourism season comes to an end after Labor Day. For multiple businesses in St. Michaels, it could mean a slow down in business.Businesses in St. Michaels are preparing for the fall and winter months by cutting back on some costs.\n\"It's something that we know is coming every year,\" Craig Schury, owner of Pemberton Pharmacy & Gift St. Michaels, said. \"This year has been a little more difficult than most, so we're prepared. We pair down our staff a little bit and we try to keep our merchandise pretty tight. If we control those cost, we know we can be alright.\"\nAccording to some business owners in St. Michaels, this year's tourism season has not been as good as previous years. While data specific to this year's tourism in St. Michaels is not yet available, domestic tourism nationally has seen a slow down.\nAccording to Bank of America, their aggregated card data showed softer lodging, tourism and airline spending in 2025.\nSome St. Michales businesses plan shift merchandise to fit with upcoming seasons in hopes of keeping revenues up.\n\"We have less families in the fall, more couples, more anniversaries, more getaways, baby moons once the kids are back in school,\" said Courtney James, manager for The Preppy Redneck store.\n\"So, it's a different vibe in that a lot of people stop on their way to the beach in the summer and they have more families. Boating season also goes into October. So, a lot more people when it's cooler come out on their boats, um, which is a different vibe too. Each one brings kind of a different vibe.\"\nWhile the shift in merchandise and savings is key for business, the one major factor business owners hope to continue to see during the fall and winter months is support from the local community.\n\"It's paramount,\" said Jay Hudson, owner for Blue Heron Coffee. \"We're here for the community, so having the community support throughout the winter means the world. I look at the community as more of the sustainable business model, they're here every day, so their support means all the world. Tourism kind of comes and gos, but to have the community support, not just through the winter, just in general, means the world to a business.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "NEW HEIGHTS\n\n March 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 804\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As March Madness is set to tip off, three of the most recognizable names in college basketball are in the women's tournament: Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers.Clark drew record crowds and ratings all season long. Reese has LSU in contention for a second straight national championship. Bueckers is finally healthy and doing things on the court for UConn reminiscent of her freshman season when she was the AP Player of the Year.\nThrow in a few stellar freshmen like JuJu Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo and the game is reaching heights it's never seen.\n\"One thousand percent we've seen a shift in just the perception of women's college basketball in general,\" USC coach Lindsay Gottlieb said. \"It doesn't have to be at the detriment of men's college basketball. The increased coverage and star power these players have; they are legitimate, popcorn-worthy type of players.\"\nFor countless seasons, the buzz around the NCAA tournaments have often been on the men's game. The one-and-done stars, the juggernaut blueblood programs, the buzzer beaters and athleticism all getting more attention. The women's game has pretty much all of that too, and the ratings and attendance this season suggest casual fans are fully engaged with a game that boasts star power and an increasingly high level of play.\nIt helps that the women's players stick around for three, four or even five years without the chance to leave early for the pros so fans get to know them and watch them grow. Three years ago, Clark said she thought women's players should be allowed to turn pro after their freshman year, like the men can.\nInstead, she stuck around and had a record-setting year that grabbed the nation's attention.\n\"It's really, really evident that there's stars out there in this game,\" UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. \"Whereas before I think they were there, but nobody wanted to acknowledge it and appreciate it as much. ... They're just really good. Everybody is going around telling everybody how good they are. They're all visible.\"\nESPN said it just saw the most watched women's college basketball regular season in more than 15 years, with viewership up 37% on its platforms from last season. That doesn't really even include the Clark effect as Iowa's star wasn't on the network much this season. Iowa's ratings on Fox Sports were the highest in a generation.\nESPN plans to show all of Iowa's games, including a few on ABC, as far as the No. 1 seed advances in the tourney.\n\"It's not just UConn and Tennessee on TV,\" Auriemma said. \"Those kids are on TV a lot. They're in the limelight a lot. They know how to handle it because they're used to it now.\"\nClark, who broke the NCAA all-time scoring record this season, has helped six different networks reach all-time viewership marks for women's basketball over the past year, starting with last season's NCAA championship game that drew nearly 10 million viewers.\n\"I kind of get to be in the spotlight and I get to change people's viewpoint of how they see women's basketball,\" Clark said before the season. \"The amount of people that have come up to me and said, 'I've never watched women's basketball before before you and your team ... .' Some people could take that as a negative. But to me that's a positive. We're finally getting them to turn on the TV and watch it, but not only watch it once. They're coming back for more.\"\nPeople aren't just watching, they are also coming to games too. All five of the power conferences had huge crowds for their tournaments. The SEC and Big Ten had their best attendance ever. The Pac-12, ACC and Big 12 weren't far behind.\n\"The big names continue to put up big numbers and people are watching and the media is paying attention,\" Bueckers said. \"The tournament will be great and will continue the rise of women's basketball.\"\nFans who pack the arenas are also sticking around afterward, hoping to get a coveted autograph. The importance of the moment isn't lost on the game's stars. Clark, Reese, Bueckers, Watkins and many others spend time postgame signing and taking pictures with not only young girls, but boys, too.\n\"There were 400 people in the stands before she got here and now we're selling out,\" Gottlieb said of Watkins. \"We've got NBA players who want to see her, WNBA players, musicians and actors too. Regular fans also, it's a diversified crowd. Little boys and girls who ask me if I know JuJu. Could they meet Juju? Grown men you run into in downtown LA.\"\nEven when Clark leaves for the WNBA after the NCAA Tournament, the future of women's basketball is still strong with Bueckers, Watkins, Hidalgo and many other up-and-coming players.\n\"It's going to get even better. So many kids coming out of high school are just unbelievably good,\" Auriemma said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She shared an experience she had with a doctor who downplayed the pain she was experiencing because of endometriosis.\n\"All I could think about was my nieces or some other younger generation, laying in that bed and being spoken to that way and not knowing how to advocate for themselves. And that made me really angry. So it is kind of my theme this year is just, please advocate for yourself,\" Hannawald said.\nShe highlighted the need for doctors to listen to and understand patients' experiences and for women to advocate for themselves regarding their healthcare.\nOTHER ACTIONS\nThe County Council unanimously approved several other items, including:\nReappointing Jennifer Williams to the Police Accountability Board.Appointing Tanisha Shields, case manager for Tabot Caroline County from the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services, to the Local Drug and Alcohol Abuse Council.The council received a request from Critchlow Adkins Children's Center for a letter of support for their effort to secure a state bond initiative of $500,000 to expand their space.

    "content": "Talbot school board dives into test score trends\n\n September 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 695\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot school officials took a deeper look at state test scores last week, indicating upward trends in math and English for some grades and dips in others.At a work session on Sept. 15, Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, presented to Talbot Board of Education members breakdowns of 2024-2025 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program scores by grade and student group.\nThe presentation showed increases from the previous year in English proficiency for third and fourth grades, but drops for fifth and eighth grades. Math proficiency spiked year-to-year for fourth, sixth and seventh grades, but the number of students proficient algebra significantly fell.\nThe deeper dive came after the state released test score data for the 2024-2025 school year last month. While proficiency rates increased statewide, Talbot County students saw mixed results. English proficiency dropped to 45.4%, 16th in the state and the largest year-to-year decrease (1.9%) of all districts.\nIn math, 18.9% of students were proficient, 18th in the state and nearly even with the previous year's mark. Other counties, such as Dorchester, saw notable gains, rising spots in the statewide rankings.\nTwo days after the Sept. 15 work session, Talbot Board of Ed Member Deborah Bridges said at a monthly meeting that the district's results kept her up at night.\n\"After our work session on Monday night, I couldn't sleep,\" Bridges said. \"Our scores, it upset me so much. And I wondered, what are we missing? What is going on in our schools?\"\nBoard members largely agreed that the results aren't a matter of pointing fingers at teachers or staff. Instead, they are focused finding solutions to fix some of the problem areas.\nBoard President Emily Jackson said at the work session that she hopes school officials can begin to pinpoint some reasons behind the data trends.\n\"If I look at us, and we're going down, whereas a neighboring county who has a similar population of kids and they're going up, I want to know why,\" Jackson said.\nEinhorn said while the state tests are an \"important measure,\" it's one of many ways to assess academic achievement and growth.\n\"This is one assessment given at a single period of time, which does not always accurately reflect what students know and what they're able to do overall,\" Einhorn said.\nENGLISH\nFifth and tenth grades suffered the largest proficiency drops of 5.6% and 10%, respectively. But fourth grade proficiency rose to 50% in the most recent results. And while third grade proficiency dipped from last year's 47.9% mark, it's still at 43.6%, an improvement over a 35% rate two years ago.\n\"This really speaks to the work that this board has invested in early literacy, and starting to see that trend move up,\" Einhorn said at the work session.\nMeanwhile, most student groups followed the district's overall trend of slightly decreasing in English proficiency. Asian students fell from 68.9% to 51.2%, while Talbot's multilingual learners dropped from 8.7% to 5.1%.\nMATH\nOne of the sharpest drops came in Algebra II proficiency: 32.8% of students passed the state test in 2023-2024; only 7.1% passed in 2024-2025.\nEinhorn acknowledged that as an \"area of need.\" She noted that new math standards for K-8 will go into effect next school year. And in two years, the district will begin integrated algebra courses, infusing geometry concepts, she said.\nFourth grade rose nearly six percentage points to 32% proficiency this past year, while seventh grade had a similar hike from 11% to 17%.\nBy student group, one result stood out: Black students in the district remain under 5% proficient in math. Einhorn admitted the shortcoming.\n\"The less than 5% is indicating that we are still underserving our Black students and that we still need to continue looking at strategies that better prepare them to show what they know and are able to do in mathematics,\" Einhorn said.\nBoard Member Dyshekia Strawberry said she'd like to see the district work with community partners to specifically tackle the gap in math proficiency for Black students.\nBoard members thanked Einhorn for presenting the detailed trends, acknowledging that there's work to be done to get some of the numbers going in a positive direction.\n\"We have to do better, and we're open to hear how we're going to do that,\" Jackson said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Almost a quarter of a century later, it remains one of that institution's most popular exhibits.\nI was one of the lucky fellows who received a copy of Johnson's new book when it came out in October.\nInitially, truth be told, I wasn't sure what I would think of a book about a kitchen, fool that I am. Anyone who knows Julia Child, read her books or watched her television shows, knows that a book about Julia Child's kitchen is a book about Julia Child.\nIt's been a long time since I've had so much fun reading a book.\nAnd the word \"fun\" is apt. Again and again in the book, as people recall cooking with Child in her kitchen or a meal they shared there, the word they use to describe both their host and the place is \"fun.\"\nWhich is not to say that serious labor did not take place in that kitchen.\nThe book makes it clear that Child and her husband Paul were both workhorses. In the early television shows, the sponsoring public television station, WGBH Boston, couldn't afford retakes or editing. Julia had to begin upon a complicated recipe, carry it through, instructing all along, and arrive at a finished product that she could take a bite out of in just 28 minutes flat. The cameras shut off at 28 minutes, and there was no going back.\nTo accomplish this feat of legerdemain, she and Paul would practice for hours at home before a show, choosing which elements of a recipe to demonstrate, deciding how to demonstrate those elements and carefully working out the language to use in explaining them.\nThe whole thing was choreographed from beginning to end and different stages of the cooking prepared in advance so that, \"through the magic of TV,\" they could be displayed at the proper time as if just pulled from the oven.\nYet somehow, Julia always came across as relaxed and enjoying herself. And it wasn't a guise.\nOne of the things I found most endearing about \"Julia Child's Kitchen\" is the way sections on subjects such as the kitchen's organizing principles inevitably end up revealing the love Paul Child felt for his wife, the care he took in setting up that kitchen and showcasing her art. In letters to his brother, Paul sometimes referred to his wife as \"Julie.\"\nJulia called her kitchen \"the soul of the house,\" and her nephew, Alex Prud'homme, called the table where meals were served in that kitchen \"the center of the universe.\"\nUnsurprisingly for that time and a family of their class, the Childs had a formal dining room, but Julia's preferred place to serve friends a meal was the kitchen. Julia's unpretentious attitude toward entertaining (and herself) is made clear in her explanation for the placement of that kitchen table, \"I want the dining table in the middle of the room because, like a sheepdog, I need to be right there in the midst of everyone.\"\nThat statement is so characteristic of the woman we meet in Johnson's book. Julia Child never fails to charm, yet somehow she never seems to patronize or fawn.\nThe book itself is like a party at Julia's house. You meet fascinating people, hear terrific stories, experience a magical place, and, at the very least, get to imagine yourself enjoying extraordinary meals.\nSpeaking of stories, I can tell you from long experience that the author of \"Julia Child's Kitchen\" is a great storyteller in person as well as in her writing. And so I ask the pleasure of your company on March 3 at 6 p.m. for an evening in Julia Child's kitchen, courtesy of the Smithsonian's Paula Johnson. Trust me, you're in for a real treat. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Talbot school board sees test scores, improvement initiatives\n\n September 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 836\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — State test scores released last month show a slight increase in math and English proficiency levels at both the district and state levels.Talbot County's Board of Education discussed that trend and others during a work session on Monday, taking a first deep dive into the test results from 2023-2024's Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program.\nIn English, 47.3% of Talbot County Public Schools students tested proficient, a jump of 2.8% from 44.5% in 2022-2023. In math, 18.3% of students were proficient, up 1.1% from 17.2% the year prior. The district slots in 14th and 18th, respectively, in those categories among the state's 24 districts.\nENGLISH TRENDS\"One of the things that the board is always interested in is how does Talbot County Public Schools compare to other districts in the state,\" said Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership, while presenting the English results. \"And I wish that I could give you better news and say that we have flip-flopped the map, but if you compare this year's results to last year across the state, you will see very little change. There is not a single district in the state who is leapfrogging in improvements on this map.\"\nEinhorn and Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi emphasized that the district internally tracks student learning levels. This is done at benchmarks throughout the year.\n\"I can assure this board that more than 47% of our students are mastering grade level standards,\" Einhorn said of the English proficiency rate. \"It's just that they are not showing it across the state on this particular assessment.\"\nSome positives for the English rates included third grade proficiency and the growth for certain cohorts and subgroups. Third grade English proficiency saw a significant jump from the 2022-2023 school year.\nEinhorn pointed out that in 2023, sixth grade students were 40.1% proficient. That same group of students came in at 43.8% proficient on the seventh grade test. \"For that cohort of students, it's growth,\" Einhorn said.\nEinhorn said all student groups saw growth in English rates, though Black students had the smallest increase.\n\"We are reaching every student in some sense, in some capacity,\" Board President Emily Jackson said of the subgroups. \"Maybe not as well as we could, but we're getting there, we are making growth, and that's what I want to see.\"\nMATH TRENDSIn math, the district has many initiatives to increase proficiency. Einhorn said the number of elementary math coaches has increased from three to six, along with an addition of one middle school math coach.\nThe district is implementing an adaptive testing program called Measures of Academic Progress for kindergarten through eighth grade to track student growth.\nIn 2023-2024's state test scores, TCPS students showed increases across the board.\n\"We see slight increases for each one of our student groups,\" Einhorn said. \"We have less of an increase for our Hispanic and Latino students. And we still continue to have fewer than 5% of our Black students and our multilingual learners proficient in mathematics.\"\nFor proficiency levels below 5%, the state does not indicate exact percentages. Of the 24 districts, the Talbot district is one of three below the 5% mark in math proficiency among Black students, and one of nine districts below the 5% mark in math proficiency among multilingual students.\nEinhorn and Jackson each thanked the Talbot County Council for its commitment in funding education, particularly the math coaches in elementary schools.\n\"When you see movement like we did in third grade,\" Jackson said, \"I think that we are making really intentional, really important, really good funding decisions that have a big impact on learning.\"\nEXPERT REVIEWSAs required by the state's education initiative, Blueprint for Maryland's Future, experts vetted by the Maryland Department of Education will be reviewing school districts across the state. Einhorn said state reviewers will be visiting three elementary schools in Talbot County this year.\nThose schools will be Chapel District Elementary, St. Michaels Elementary and White Marsh Elementary. They were chosen for separate reasons. Einhorn stated: Chapel for reviewers to look at literacy instruction, St. Michaels to review practices for multilingual learners and White Marsh due to success in state testing.\n\"They had significant growth in their math achievement across all grades in this last MCAP assessment,\" Einhorn said of White Marsh Elementary. \"So they want to know what White Marsh is doing well.\"\nJackson asked how the district can take lessons learned from these three schools to its largest elementary school, Easton Elementary.\n\"Can you speak to how we plan to address that?\" Jackson asked. \"How do you take what you've learned at a very small, very specific population and duplicate it or replicate it at a school like Easton Elementary?\"\n\"One of the things that we do even though it's a larger school, we have committed the same types of resources but just on a larger scale,\" Einhorn said. \"So while our smaller elementaries might have one math coach, we see multiple math coaches to be able to service the number of classrooms that we have at Easton Elementary.\"\nEinhorn said other schools in the district will have state reviews in the next year or two. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Things to remember if buying or selling this spring\n\n May 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MID-SHORE BOARD OF REALTORS | Section: Real Estate \n \n 524\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n If someone is buying or selling this Spring, they may have noticed a few new ways of doing things since the last time they went through this process, noted Michelle Abplanalp, president of Mid-Shore Board of Realtors.There are several real estate changes that went into effect in August related to showing homes and compensation.\nFor buyers, a written buyer agreement is now required. Buyers and their Realtors will need to reach an agreement regarding how the agent will be paid for their services and put it in writing before seeing a home. \"However, don't get hung up on signing this agreement,\" Abplanalp said. \"This agreement can be specific. It can be to see one specific home, it can be for one day or one week, whatever you negotiate.\"\nBefore signing this agreement, buyers should ensure it reflects the terms they have negotiated with their Realtor and that they understand exactly what services will be provided and how much these services will cost, the Board of Realtors said.\nThe buyer agreement must include four items:\nA specific and clear disclosure of the amount or rate of compensation the agent will receive or how this amount will be determined must be stated.\nThe compensation rate must be objective and stated as an amount, a flat fee, a percentage, or an hourly rate. The compensation cannot be open-ended.\nThe agreement prohibits the Realtor from receiving compensation for services from any source that exceeds the amount or rate agreed to by the buyer.\nThe agreement must note that the Realtor fees and commissions are fully negotiable and not set by law.\nThese written agreements apply to both in-person and live virtual home tours but do not apply to open houses or inquiries about services. The home seller may agree to offer compensation to their Realtor, or the seller can offer to assist with closing costs or home inspections.\nFor home sellers, the offers of compensation (when a seller or a seller's agent shares compensation with a buyer's agent) cannot be shared on Multiple Listing Services. MLSs are local marketplaces used by both buyer and seller agents to share information about homes for sale. Offers of compensation are still an option but are now communicated off the MLS should a home seller choose to pay the buyer's agent fee.\nSellers may consider doing this as a way of marketing their home or making their listing more attractive to buyers.\nPer Abplanalp, whether buying or selling, the Realtors compensation or fees remain fully negotiable and are not set by law. Realtors have agreed to abide by the Realtor Code of Ethics and to provide clear and transparent discussions with their clients about compensation.\n\"What's important to know is these practice changes provide consumers on both sides of a residential transaction with additional choice and transparency,\" Abplanalp said. \"It helps to have this discussion upfront so there are no misunderstandings. I have found that my clients appreciate knowing what I will do for them, what services I provide, and at what cost.\"\nThe Mid-Shore Board of Realtors mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.

In referring to the recent election, Ms. Gill states that the newly elected Talbot County school board members Ann O'Connor and Karla Wieland-Cherry are also members of Moms for Liberty. Ms. Gill describes the Moms as a \"conservative national group\" who advocate for \"changes in curriculum and policies.\"First of all, both Mrs. O'Connor and Mrs. Cherry have repeatedly stated they are not members of Moms for Liberty; they merely participated in a debate sponsored by the Moms in which, to her credit, Ms. Jurrius also took part.\nSecondly, Moms for Liberty is a support group for parents, teachers and citizens who are concerned with the education of the next generation. They provide resources for parents as well as information in educational trends throughout the country. While I have never attended one of their meetings, I do receive their newsletter and follow them on social media. Plus I have numerous friends who regularly attend the meetings.\nTheir agenda is to maintain parental rights through grades K through 12. Additionally, Superintendent Dr. Sharon Pepukayi, and even some of her staff, have attended three or four meetings. If it was so extreme why would they continue to return? Why is this continually portrayed by the Left as a terrible thing?\nThirdly, I wish Ms. Gill had been more specific when mentioning the \"changes in curriculum and policies\" that the Moms are advocating. Is she referring to better scores in English and mathematics, which the Moms advocate? Is she referring to less violence in the schools and classrooms, which they also advocate? Does she mean the schools' dispensing of contraceptives to children, opposed not only by the Moms but also by many parents?\nAs for the mention of concentration camps, in 2019 Trump was criticized by the Left for detention centers that had been built by Obama. Remember the children in cages? That happened under Obama, too. Trying to conflate Trump with the Nazis by mentioning \"concentration camps\" is actually a horrific insult to the millions of victims of the real Nazis. Plus everyone was trying to escape from Hitler's Germany. If America was so bad under Trump, why did people still risk their lives and fortunes to live here?\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Local K-9 units work to overcome retirements from cannabis law\n\n May 24, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 917\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In just a handful of months, K-9 Knox is making an impact at the Easton Police Department.The nearly 2-year-old black lab completed training in January. In 2025's first quarter alone, she was deployed 17 times, making six drug arrests alongside her handler, Pfc. Mark Schinault.\n\"She has that drive for her reward, her toy after she does a good scan,\" Schinault said. \"That means the world to her, so she's very driven to work.\"\nKnox is part of Easton's new guard of K-9s. Last year, three dogs trained in marijuana detection were forced into early retirement due to the legalization of recreational cannabis use legalization in Maryland, which took effect July 2023.\nEaston is not the only agency looking to rebuild its K-9 team in the wake of the legislation. Across the state, law enforcement agencies are working to fund and fill their K-9 units, which serve crucial roles not only in deterring crime, but also in connecting with the community.\nPolice officers largely agree that dogs trained to sniff marijuana can't be used to detect drug offenses any longer, nor does the dogs' expertise hold up in court.\n\"I really didn't want to go down the road because I didn't want to be challenged in the courtroom,\" Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said.\nKnox joined K-9 Waylon in Easton, and soon two other young dogs not imprinted on marijuana will fill out the town's K-9 unit. Lt. Tim Larrimore said it has been a \"complete rebuild\" for the unit since the law passed.\nTrained dogs can sometimes cost around $14,000, Larrimore said. Younger, untrained pups are significantly less, though they require major time commitments for training and certification.\nAcross the state, the work of K-9 dogs — depending on their training — often includes drug sniffing, tracking of suspects or missing subjects, and explosives detection. Knox is certified in drug detection and on her way to certification in tracking.\nSchinault and Knox completed more than 60 hours of one-on-one training before she was certified in drug detection. Easton opted to go with untrained dogs to save costs and build rapport between K-9s and officers.\nWhile Maryland K-9s are no longer sniffing for marijuana, Larrimore says their work is more important than ever in combating drug offenses.\n\"This odor of marijuana was enough before 2023 to give us probable cause to search. Now that's out,\" Larrimore said. \"So now you need the ability to smell something that the human nose isn't necessarily good at detecting. It's the dog that gets you there.\"\nPLAYING CATCH UP\nKent County Sgt. Scott Lockerman has a passion for not just his K-9 partner, Khari, but for all police dogs across the state. He is president of the Maryland Police K9 Foundation, a nonprofit that helps police agencies buy, train and protect their four-legged workers. The foundation paid for one of Easton's new dogs.\nLockerman said that after the legalization of cannabis, there was roughly a 60-40 split of agencies that could quickly get their K-9 units back on track versus those that were more affected by unexpected retirements. But he said progress is being made across all departments.\n\"Most of the agencies were able to replenish the dogs,\" Lockerman said.\nAt the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office, one K-9 retired early after the cannabis law was passed, while multiple dogs retired shortly before. The agency worked ahead to bring in replacement dogs not trained to detect marijuana so the state legislation didn't present too many challenges.\n\"We saw it coming,\" Sheriff James Phillips said. \"It was on the horizon.\"\nSix K-9s currently work for the Dorchester Sheriff's Office. Three can assist in patrols and narcotic detection, two work in narcotics only, and one bloodhound specializes in tracking. Phillips said the office has adequate funding to fill its seventh and final spot for a K-9 trained in detecting explosives.\nFunding often comes from grants, local donations, organizations such as the K9 Foundation and county councils. Phillips said it's \"mind-boggling\" how generous people have been in donating dogs to the Sheriff's Office.\nIn addition to purchasing the dogs, agencies pay for safety equipment (like bulletproof vests) and health payments. Departments are also on the hook for vet costs incurred by retired dogs, per state law. For a retired K-9, departments could pay up to as much as $2,500 a year, capped at $10,000 per dog.\nLarrimore, the Easton lieutenant, says that hasn't yet presented a major funding challenge, though it could down the road.\n\"It hasn't hit us yet,\" he said. \"These dogs are just retired last year. They're young, they're healthy.\"\nCOMMUNITY IMPACT\nWhen the highly-skilled dogs aren't working a case, they're often out in the community showing more of their friendly side.\nIn Dorchester County, Sgt. Steve Twilley says the K-9 unit bridges the gap between the Sheriff's Office and the community. The dogs especially help police build trust with kids.\n\"Next thing you know, that kid's come to you for help instead of lashing out or doing something at school,\" Twilley said.\nSchinault and Knox attended a recent Coffee with a Cop event this spring. Schinault said they're very involved with community policing efforts.\nPhillips and Twilley say the same is true in Dorchester County. Whatever dollar amount is spent on police dogs, Phillips says, comes back to the Sheriff's Office \"10 times over because of the relationships that we build with the kids and the people.\"\n\"I think an agency that's trying to do today's police work and doesn't have the K-9 ability out there, I don't think they're a full police agency,\" Phillips said. \"I think it completes the police agency by having the K-9s.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Council member Lynn Mielke originally brought forth the resolution earlier this summer.\nMielke said she's pleased the task force was established and looks forward to serving on the body. Council Vice President Pete Lesher thanked Mielke for leading the effort.\n\"I look forward to working with the folks that we'll be calling together for that,\" Lesher said.\nThe task force will make recommendations to the County Council on housing, health care, transportation and meal services for homeless seniors.\nIt will consist of representatives from the following entities, among others: Commission on Aging, Delmarva Community Services, Talbot Interfaith Shelter, Neighborhood Service Center, Talbot County Health Department, Easton Town Council and County Council.\nAt the July 29 work session, Talbot Interfaith Executive Director Julie Lowe cited an increase in calls from seniors as evidence that homelessness is growing.\nIn 2023, the shelter received 15 calls from men 55 and older and 14 calls from women 55 and older. One year later, those marks increased to 30 and 23, respectively.\nThis year, the Easton-based shelter has already received 19 calls from men and 13 calls from women in that age range, Lowe said.\nOther nonprofit and health care leaders advocated for the task force's creation at that meeting. They said it's especially needed to help align local nonprofits, county boards and the health department.\n\"There isn't anybody who is behind all of these organizations pushing to keep everybody connected,\" said Rachel Smith, chair of the county's Commission on Aging. \"And that's what we found is one of the biggest problems. We have all these organizations out here that are doing so much great work, but then we've got to figure out a way to connect so we can help all these people.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Moore had decided to postpone implementing the experimental Blueprint for Maryland in our schools, due to the $2.7 billion deficit accrued by the state of Maryland.The Blueprint has been described as follows:\n\"It has taken the focus of schools off teaching students the academic and content knowledge they need to be successful adults in our society and made them 'one stop shopping' for services like medical, dental, nutritional, social engineering and mental health. It has promoted the implementation of 'restorative discipline' which has created a generation of students who are out of control and violent since there are no consequences for bad behavior. It has drained our schools of teachers as they flee to other states where working conditions are better even if the salaries are lower. These are just some of the negative impacts.\" (Easton Gazette, Dec. 20, 2024)\nHow disappointed was I to read in The Star Democrat (Jan. 15, 2025) that the Talbot Board of Education wishes to implement the Blueprint anyway, especially equity in math, with an $8.6 million increase to the school budget. With nearly 60% of Talbot County students (grades 3-8) showing a lack of proficiency in basic English language skills, while mathematics proficiency for Talbot County students stands at a dismal 17.2%, the last thing we need is for our children to be guinea pigs in yet another social experiment.\nWhat is equity in math? According to Edutopia: \"Math teachers can use short activities based on student goals related to equity in order to make classes feel more inclusive and accessible.\" The key words are \"feel\" \"inclusive\" and \"accessible.\"\nI was a sixth grader once, a sixth grader who hated math class. We had a strict teacher, of whom most of us were afraid. But we all learned to multiply and divide, in spite of the negative feelings, unlike, it appears, many of today's children who are not even being encouraged to memorize their times tables.\nThose negative feelings can give way to feelings of confidence and assurance when a subject has been mastered. I beg our educators to return to basics and stop making our children the latest casualties of yet another half-baked, ill-conceived progressive scheme for remaking society according to the designs of Karl Marx or Saul Alinsky.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Program Open Space threatened\n\n March 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 285\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Program Open Space was created in 1969 and was funded through of a transfer tax of 0.5 percent on every real estate transaction in the state. This new special tax was designed to directly tie development to available funding for open space and recreational facilities for the public good. Now because of the state budget deficit the Program Open Space funds are being threatened with total removal for the next four years.Program Open Space supports parks, forests and wildlife management areas and is an important contributor to the state's conservation commitments and goals. It also supports community playgrounds, ball fields, tennis courts, hiking trails, historic sites, Chesapeake Bay water access and multiple other community benefits. These programs are important for citizens' wellbeing and also have substantial economic benefit. Quality of life is a very important factor in home and business investment in a community.\nI am impressed with the value of open spaces when I visit the Oxford Conservation Park and see the park being enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities. I see toddlers running around, senior citizens — some proceeding slowly with the help of a cane, dog owners with their enthusiastic pets and many others enjoying the outdoors.\nI am particularly mindful of the many citizens who safely walked in the park during the worst days of the pandemic for exercise, tranquility and inspiration. The park also has become a highly valued locale for viewing wildlife with, for example, a large number of bird species identified, including recent sightings of quail.\nProgram Open Space provides very important benefits to residents of the Eastern Shore. I encourage you to contact our Talbot County representatives ask that they continue funding for Program Open Space.\nSARAH RAMSEY\nOxford \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Realtors work to protect themselves on job\n\n September 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A15 | Section: News \n \n 584\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Smoke detectors and locking doors are obvious safety techniques for homeowners, but there is so much more to keeping homeowners and Realtors safe during the buying and selling process.Real estate leads come in many ways, and a referral from a friend or family member is different than a walk-in or website referral. Realtors are in a unique position that sometimes puts them in harms way.As a buyer or seller being aware of this will make all involved have a better understanding of why Realtors ask or do certain things.Local Realtors say they feel the most vulnerable at open houses and when showing property. Nationally, 4% of agents reported being victims of assault, robbery, theft and other undisclosed crimes.Many of the incidents occurred at open houses, home showings and in the agent's own vehicle.Although locally this is rare, it is still a possibility. Each September, Realtors are reminded about potential risks on the job and are asked to review the Member Safety Report (NAR.Realtor/Safety) for themselves and their clients.Allowing strangers to enter your homes always comes with risks, noted Megan Rosendale, president of Mid-Shore Board of Realtors. That is why jewelry, valuables, and medicines, should be locked up or removed from the property.Some agents make use of visual recordings and posted signs that say \"camera in use\" to try to deter thieves. There was a situation a few years ago in Talbot County where a person was going to multiple open houses and taking prescriptions, the police and other agents were notified.Realtors also use a lock box system called SentriLock.SentiLock records the code of the agent who opened the box plus the time the box was opened and when the key was returned. A combination box does not have this protection, and once the combination code is given out there is no way to know who is entering your property.Rosendale said, \"I also speak with my clients about not showing their home by themselves, not all agents, and buyers are who they say they are. We tell our children not to talk to strangers.I tell my sellers not to talk to other agents or buyers and have them refer all inquiries to me.\" Here are a few ways some Realtors protect themselves and their clients:▪ They take a picture of the license plate of the buyer's car and the client's identification.▪ They do not drive or ride with their clients unless they know them well.▪ They hold the first meeting with the clients in the real estate office or a public location.▪ They do not hold an open house alone.▪ They never meet a client for the first time at a vacant property.▪ They use a smart phone or application to track their whereabouts and to alert colleagues in case of▪ emergency.▪ They have their phone charged, carry a charging cord and hotspot for poor cell phone areas.▪ They carry mace and maybe even a weapon.We understand that meeting clients in private locations can be a part of our job, as well as hosting open houses and showing vacant properties in areas with poor or no phone coverage, noted Rosendale.That is why it is important to take preventative measures and be aware of the surroundings to help the agents and clients stay safe from would-be criminals.The Mid-Shore Board of Realtors mission is to advocate for its members and the public to preserve the right to own, transfer and utilize real property.

We want to go back every year and let our kids have these ideal summers, running around barefoot in the grass and swimming in the lake. It has a really wholesome feel that really resonates with us, and it's great to spend real time there.Q: How have you enjoyed working with your husband. actor Jonathan Silverman (\"Weekend at Bernie's\"), on A: He's one of the kindest, most generous people on the planet and if he's going to do something with me (professionally), I want our characters to be completely at odds with each other. Frankly, there's nothing more fun than when you've been in a long-term relationship with someone and you know them inside and out - and you don't fight with them much - to go at it with them on camera. I can't even tell you how cathartic it is.We see each other all the time, and part of a happy relationship is a healthy boundary. Many people have said to us over the years, \"Why don't you guys do a show together?\" Well, it's because I want us to stay married! One of the reasons The CW wanted this show is that Jonny is such a recognizable American actor, and I think that's a nice advantage.Q: How does that work for you yourself, in terms of being well-known in both the U.S. and your native CanadaftA: I think a lot of Canada doesn't even know I'm Canadian. I think I've done nine series at this point, and I've been on everyone's television for 24 years.Part of my excitement in doing this show initially was to boost my profile in Canada, because I have always been patriotic and proud to be a Canadian, though doing a strictly Canadian show is something I've very rarely done. In the way my character Lidia goes back home (in \"Moonshine\"), this was going back home for me as well. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They had a ribbon cutting to open the new field near Moton Park on May 11.\nLocated in Easton, the nonprofit provides scholarships, afterschool programing, summer camp, and more to empower at-risk youth in the community.\nA white tent full of local government officials listened to different speakers at a podium set up right in front of the field.\nFrank Gunsallus, president of the Easton Town Council, said, \"I want to extend special thanks to everyone involved in making this project a reality. From our dedicated town staff to our numerous community volunteers and generous sponsors.\"\nThe small crowd of officials clapped as the colors were raised on either side of the podium.\n\"Let's continue to support and invest in our parks and recreational facilities to ensure that Easton remains a vibrant and engaging community for everyone,\" Gunsallus said.\nDel. Tom Hutchison (R-Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) and Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Wicomico) came up to the microphone.\nHutchison said, \"You have done such great things for the community. This is a great addition for the children and youths that are here.\"\nHe presented citations to BAAM for U.S. Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin honoring BAAM's 20 years of service.\nMautz said, \"If you had been standing here 20 or 30 years ago, you wouldn't recognize where we are standing. I am looking forward to everybody kicking soccer balls out here.\"\nThe sound of DJ Hector could be heard in the distance as Amy Kreiner, president of the Talbot County Chamber of Commerce, came to the microphone to give a glass award to BAAM.\n\"It is my honor to present Derek and Dina Daily with this 20th Anniversary plaque on behalf of the Talbot County Chamber of Commerce and blessings for the next 20 years,\" Kreiner said.\nThen they stepped onto the pitch for a large red ribbon cutting to open the field up.\nWilliam Ryan is president of the board of directors for BAAM. He was smiling as he wore a BAAM sweatshirt.\n\"We want to get our kids out playing as much as possible. It is part of the town park. It is open to all. If you want to have an event, you have to check with the town. We started out small and we have just been steadily growing,\" Ryan said.\nThere were members of the construction crew that actually built the field. It was a lot more than siting a rectangle. Lucas Lees, coastal and land designer of Unity Landscapes, had a three man crew that got the drainage on the field just right.\n\"We ran into water lines we weren't expecting, but since we were putting in irrigation it was convenient that the town already owned them. It really transformed this space and completed the park,\" Lees said.\nUnity Landscape built it in 45 days.\nDerick Daly, founder of BAAM, said that key is being long-term. The relationship with the town, the donors and the staff were all long-term.\n\"We wanted a place where kids could come and call it their own. We are opening up the soccer field with the partnership of the town of Easton developing with this field for youth soccer. Come out here and just have fun. Play and enjoy yourself, get out and exercise. This could be an incubator for kids to get exposure and take it to another level,\" Daly said.\nLooking past the new soccer field, there was BAAM Fest going on closer to the community pool. There were 31 community partners, whose colorful tents lined a winding sidewalk.\n\"We started BAAM Fest to give out information about what we are doing. It turned into offering a meal to everyone. We have free lunch for everyone. We have a band as you can hear, face painting — the kids love it. We have community partners,\" Daly said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Tench Tilghman: A Talbot County-born revolutionary hero\n\n October 26, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 795\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — One of George Washington's most trusted men has roots in Talbot County, and this week he was celebrated by a local chapter of the Maryland Society of the Sons of the American Revolution.The SAR's Colonel Tench Tilghman Chapter honored its namesake after receiving proclamations from Easton and Talbot County for the inaugural Tench Tilghman Week from Oct. 19 to 24.\nTilghman, born in Talbot County in 1744 and educated there during his youth, was a primary aide-de-camp for Washington during the Revolutionary War. Wes Hagood, chapter president, has deeply researched Tilghman and his critical role as one of Washington's right-hand men.\nIn 1776, Tilghman joined Washington's staff. Washington often referred to him as \"family\" in written letters, Hagood said.\n\"He became, in a lot of ways, like a son to Washington,\" Hagood said. \"… They carried on a relationship until Tilghman died.\"\nTilghman's calling card was his duty of delivering the notice of British surrender following the Battle of Yorktown. Surrender came on Oct. 19, 1781, and Tilghman arrived in Philadelphia on Oct. 24 to confirm the news to the Continental Congress.\n\"It's probably one of his most recognizable accomplishments,\" Hagood said.\nHagood described Tilghman as \"hard working\" and smart, adding that he \"probably would have had a role in the future government had he lived.\" He provided leadership to patriot soldiers and often was responsible for finding food to sustain the troops, Hagood said.\nIn a letter to Continental Army General John Sullivan in 1781, Washington spoke highly of Tilghman.\n\"This gentleman came out a captain of one of the light infantry companies of Philadelphia, and served in the flying camp in 1776,\" Washington wrote. \"In August of the same year he joined my family, and has been in every action in which the main army was concerned. He has been a zealous servant and slave to the public, and a faithful assistant to me for nearly five years, a great part of which time he refused pay.\"\nFollowing the victory, a portrait of Washington was commissioned in 1781, depicting Tilghman and Marquis de Lafayette. Maryland-born Charles Willson Peale painted the portrait, which is displayed today in the Maryland State House.\nTilghman died in 1786, leaving behind his spouse, who spent many decades thereafter in Oxford on Tilghman's father's plantation. Today, Tilghman is buried at the Oxford Cemetery after being reinterred in 1971 from his original burial site in Baltimore.\nMARYLAND 400\nHagood, who has read all of the letters Tench Tilghman wrote to his father during the war, pointed out the Talbot County native's critical role in the Battle of Brooklyn in 1776. At that battle, a larger and more experienced British army posed a significant threat to patriot troops.\nOwen Lourie, \"Finding the Maryland 400\" project director at the Maryland State Archives, calls that the \"first major battle.\" Lourie says the troops known as the Maryland 400, along with some from Pennsylvania and Delaware, reformed to attack the enemy after a damaging British charge.\nWhile there were massive casualties, Lourie says the Maryland 400 \"bottled up\" the British and prevented them from delivering a \"final death blow\" to the other continental soldiers that were escaping.\n\"It is probably not too much of an exaggeration to say that they saved the Continental Army,\" Lourie said.\nWitness to the heroic efforts, Tilghman applauded the Col. William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Regiment, Lourie notes. \"No Regular Troops ever made a more gallant Resistance than Smallwood's Regiment,\" Tilghman wrote in a memoir.\nLourie and the Maryland State Archives are working to identify and write biographies on as many of those soldiers as possible. There were more than 1,000 Maryland troops, and his historian work has helped identify over 800. He says he's focused on \"telling the small stories\" of those Marylanders that may not have been thought of in hundreds of years.\nLourie is presenting a history of the Maryland 400 at the Talbot County Free Library on Saturday at 11 a.m., an event sponsored by the Tench Tilghman Chapter which wraps up Tench Tilghman Week.\nDana Newman, library director, says registration is open online at tcfl.org, with limited spots remaining. It will also be livestreamed on Talbot Library's YouTube channel.\nHagood is excited for Tench Tilghman Week to return next October and for years to come.\n\"What better way would there be for us as a chapter to fulfill our mission of educating current and future generations about all of this than to have a week dedicated to Colonel Tench Tilghman,\" Hagood said. \"And this year, just start with one event. But the idea is, we'll do this every year.\"\nFollowing the Maryland 400 presentation on Saturday, a free program on how to join the Sons of the American Revolution and Daughters of the American Revolution will be held at the Talbot County Free Library from 2 to 4 p.m. in the Frederick Douglass Room. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "EDITORIAL: 10-cent paper bag fee should be optional\n\n September 7, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editorials \n \n 923\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Earlier this week, the Easton Town Council debated a proposal to remove a 10-cent fee on paper bags used to bag groceries and other purchased merchandise.We think that fee should be optional — if retailers need to charge the fee to cover the cost of the bags, they should be able to do so. But it is also important that store owners be able to provide the bags at no charge as part of the service they offer customers.\nThe April 2023 Easton ordinance banning the use of plastic bags required retailers to charge customers a fee of at least 10 cents for each paper bag used, encouraging shoppers to bring reusable bags. It came as the Town Council banned the use of plastic bags for packaging purchases in stores such as groceries and retail shops. Restaurants and food establishments are exempt from the ban.\nThis is a hot topic in Eastern Shore communities.\nLate last month, the Commissioners of Oxford debated a similar ban for Oxford before tabling the proposed ordinance.\nLike it does in Easton, Oxford Town Attorney Lyndsey Ryan said the Oxford ban would apply to retail establishments including grocery stores, convenience stores, shops, department stores and service stations. The ordinance would not apply to restaurants and food service establishments.\nDuring the Oxford public hearing, some business owners and employees expressed concerns with the proposed ordinance. Graham Norbury, the general manager at Safe Harbor Oxford, said that while this may be a national issue, he doesn't observe plastic bags being littered often in Oxford.\n\"Why is restricting a retailer's right to choose the best delivery mechanism for their products, why is that something that the commissioners feel necessary?\" he asked.\nOxford Vintage and Trade owner Barbara Ranson said in her six years of being in business in Oxford, she has always used paper bags. She said she doesn't understand why the commissioners are looking at this legislation when \"it may or may not target three very small businesses.\"\nWe think Oxford should follow in Easton's footsteps and ban plastic bags and even expand the ban to include restaurants and food service establishments.\nPlastic bags have severe and dire affects on the environment.\nNon-biodegradable: Plastic bags can take hundreds of years to break down in the environment. Instead of decomposing, they break into smaller pieces called microplastics, which can persist in the ecosystem for even longer.\nPollution: Plastic bags often end up in waterways and oceans, where they can cause severe pollution. Marine animals can ingest or become entangled in plastic bags, leading to injury or death.\nHarmful chemicals: As plastic bags break down, they can release harmful chemicals into the soil and water, which can contaminate ecosystems and pose risks to wildlife and human health.\nEnergy and resources: The production of plastic bags involves the use of fossil fuels and energy, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion.\nWaste management: Plastic bags can be challenging to recycle due to their lightweight and flimsy nature. They can clog machinery at recycling facilities, leading to higher costs and lower recycling rates.\nJust this week a Star Democrat editor watched a plastic grocery bag go airborne from the bed of a pickup truck crossing the Bay Bridge. The bag floated into the air where a breeze caught it and sent it flying over the Bay, eventually landing in the water. That bag became a death trap for a fish or a bird. This is not an isolated incident, we are sure readers can recount similar experiences seeing wayward plastic bags.\nSo we stand firmly behind banning plastic bags and think more towns should follow the lead of Easton and Oxford.\nOur complaint comes with the imposition of a 10-cent fee that Easton requires retailers to charge a fee if a customer requests or needs a plastic bag.\nThere is a good reason for that fee: It provides an incentive for customers to begin using reusable bags, which are far better than even the paper bags.\n\"The reason for the proposal to remove this fee comes directly from the voices of many Easton residents who are feeling its impact,\" said council President Frank Gunsallus in explaining the proposal to make the fee optional, \"especially those in lower-income brackets who are already stretching every dollar to make ends meet.\"\nGunsallus and Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery both said they've talked to residents who do not support the current 10-cent fee. The rest of the council, though, stated otherwise.\n\"I have heard from many people the exact opposite, that the ban is working and that the 10 cents is not onerous in any way, shape or form,\" Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said.\nWard 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello and Ward 4 Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis stated the fee has incentivized people to bring their own reusable bags. Abbatiello said, \"the reason for that (fee) is because paper bags pollute just as much as plastic bags do.\"\nAll valid arguments on both sides of the issue. Our thought is that this is an issue that should be left to individual retailers to decide what is best for their businesses.\nNearly everybody from the audience who spoke at Tuesday's council meeting supported leaving the mandatory fee in place.\nEaston resident Shari Wilcoxon held a different stance, questioning why the businesses are forced to charge the 10-cent fee.\n\"I don't know why people are afraid of freedom of choice,\" Wilcoxon said. \"Why don't you let the merchants decide if they want to charge or not, what's wrong with that?\"\nWe agree with Wilcoxon and hope town council members look to making the fee optional when the issue is discussed again on Sept. 16. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

These developments will provide affordable housing opportunities and commercial use for the town of Easton, developers said.The project's developers are Chesapeake Community Development, a subsidiary of The Arc focused on creating equitable, accessible and inclusive committees.\nJonathon Rondeau, president and CEO of The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, said the project will be a thriving neighborhood that will support the various housing needs of the community by offering quality affordable and market-rate rentals.\n\"When you look at a six-and-a-half-acre site, there's a real opportunity to think more broadly, but also to say, 'how do you really affect the community rather than just building something that's part of the community?'\" Rondeau said. \"But how can it be a foundation of the community?\"\nThe Arc is a nonprofit organization with a mission to support people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\nAbout 15 years ago, The Arc decided to create housing opportunities for people with disabilities, which is how Chesapeake Community Development and Chesapeake Neighbors were created.\nThough the focus was to establish affordable housing for people with disabilities, the need for affordable housing became so essential that the organization changed its mission to create affordable housing opportunities for all.\nRondeau said they manage about 70 units in Anne Arundel County and the Eastern Shore, including the Primrose and Port Streets Commons. The Arc's subsidiaries seek to create opportunities for people from disadvantaged backgrounds to access services.\nRondeau said mixing affordable and market-rate housing makes development financially viable by allowing subsidies for affordable units through market-rate rents.\nHe said though Talbot County has a high median income, there are a lot of families that live significantly below the average income. Rondeau said that there is a range of people who have a full time job but make less than $30,000 a year.\nworkers like baristas and education professionals are people who do important work in the community and should be given the access to live in the area as well, Rondeau said.\nRoss Benincasa, a consulting partner and vice president of community development, said the need for affordable housing was great in the area.\n\"Our vision is to bring a vibrant multi-purpose space to the community that incorporates a wide range of amenities and resources, including much-needed housing,\" Benincasa said in a press release earlier this month.\nRondeau said they will be hosting a community meeting at the Brookletts Place Senior Center on July 10 at 5 p.m. to hear the concerns and ideas from the local community. He emphasized that community involvement is crucial to addressing any concerns and helping design a development that can meet the people's needs.\n\"We, The Arc and Chesapeake Neighbors and Chesapeake Community Development want to be part of the community and be part of making Easton an inclusive and equitable community,\" Rondeau said. \"And projects like this allow us to do that, and we hope that the community can help be part of that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton man receives 18 years for sex assault of daughter, other crimes\n\n July 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Crime \n \n 660\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — An Easton man received an 18-year sentence on Thursday for third-degree sex offense against his then-3-year-old daughter, among other offenses.Kevin Manning, 34, appeared in court to hear his fate after entering a guilty plea for the felony sex offense and nine other counts, including witness intimidation, electronic communication harassment and violation of a protective order. Those nine counts were levied for actions he took against his daughter's mother after the Sept. 2024 assault of the daughter.\nTalbot County Circuit Court Judge Phil Cronan handed down the 18-year sentence — a term exceeding the recommended five- to 13-year range — for what he called a \"vicious and heinous\" crime.\nBefore Cronan delivered the sentence, Deputy State's Attorney Chelsea Endzel asked the court for a 30-year sentence.\nEndzel cited Manning's past sex assault convictions: a fourth-degree sex offense in Anne Arundel County in 2016 and second-degree rape in Talbot County in 2022 stemming from a 2009 incident involving Manning and an underage female living with him at the time.\nThe rape conviction was dismissed in 2023 after it was determined that the judge who postponed Manning's trial date was not designated to do so.\nEndzel argued for the extended sentence, in part, due to Manning's \"repeated harassment\" of the child's mother, Emily Hiester, beginning last September. Endzel wrote in a memo to the court that Manning contacted Hiester nearly 200 times through emails and phone calls, violating a protective order.\nEndzel read a written impact statement from Hiester, in which the mother said she couldn't bear to be in a courtroom with Manning. Hiester wrote that she has secluded herself from others and that she \"can see the pain\" in her daughter's eyes.\n\"I can't see others the same when someone I thought I knew I could trust did something so horrible,\" a portion of the statement read.\nHiester asked for Manning's sentence to be \"as much time as the court will allow.\"\nEndzel also argued that an open District Court case in which Manning is accused of assaulting an inmate at the Talbot County Detention Center factors into the danger he poses to society. The alleged assault occurred May 24.\n\"The question is not whether he will reoffend, but when,\" Endzel said.\nManning's defense attorney, Holly Brownley of the public defender's office, asked Cronan to deliver a sentence within the pre-sentence recommendations.\nManning \"had some serious traumas in his young life,\" such as the murder of his mother and being exposed to drug and substance abuse, Brownley said.\nThe 34-year-old defendant, in an orange suit, handcuffs and wide black glasses, spoke for a few minutes at the hearing Thursday. He said he wants to go to a maximum-security prison, Patuxent Institution in Jessup, to receive treatment.\nManning acknowledged his daughter was the victim and said what occurred was an accident. He disagreed with Endzel's claims that he has shown no remorse.\n\"To ostracize me from society, I don't believe's appropriate,\" Manning said, noting that since 2019, he doesn't feel he's been a \"trouble or menace\" to society.\nCronan disagreed with that assessment.\nThe judge said Manning's behavior has escalated the last 15 years. The dismissed rape conviction is \"certainly something ... in this court's mind,\" Cronan said. He added that the sex offense conviction and a related burglary crime from 2016 as well as the pending assault case from two months ago played a role.\n\"That doesn't sound to me that you haven't been any trouble,\" Cronan told Manning. \"Quite the opposite.\"\nThe judge said the facts of the case were clear: Manning assaulted his daughter and \"manipulated the mother of your child\" to try to get her to lie in court for him.\nCronan said the daughter \"should have the comfort\" to be with her father without such a thing happening.\nIn addition to the 18 years, Manning is ordered to be on probation for five years after his release, make no contact with Hiester or the daughter and not visit their residences, schools, places of employment or daycares. He will register as a Tier III sex offender. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Wiedefeld and representatives from various state agencies.State Highway Administrator William Pines spoke about his agency's efforts to improve infrastructure and safety at several high-traffic locations within Talbot County.The agency initiated a $1.5 million study of Route 328 to assess safety and capacity improvements along a 1.6-mile stretch between U.S. Route 50 and Black Dog Alley. Delays are seen in this area from turning vehicles and queueing at signalized intersections, and there are limited pedestrian and bicycle facilities, Pines said.A public meeting on the Route 328 project is tentatively scheduled for this winter.Other transportation improvements within Easton include a $600,000 project for new lighting at the intersection of Route 50 and Route 322 (Easton Bypass) to improve visibility and safety, signal improvements and pedestrian upgrades - including a Rails to Trails link - at Route 322 and Glenwood Avenue, and a new signal at Route 50 and Chapel Road that will be activated by the end of November.In 2024, SHA will begin construction on two additional projects: reconstructing the signal at Route 50 and Route 309 and upgrading the flashing signal at Route 331 and Black Dog Alley to a full signal.Two local trail projects are also receiving federal and state grant funding, Pines said.$48,000 will go toward the final design of a 1.25-mile extension of the St. Michaels Nature and Bike Trail, and $30,000 will go toward the study and preliminary design of a rail trail connecting parks in Oxford.Turning to public transit, nearly $1.1 million in operating and capital grants are being allocated to support Delmarva Community Transit.$225,000 of this will fund preventative maintenance and two new small buses, said Travis Johnston, the Maryland Transit Administration's local transit support director.Delmarva Community Services will also receive $123,000 to install a propane filling station for future propane-powered vehicles, enabling DCS to transition to a low-emission fleet.Additionally, $24,000 in highway safety grants were awarded to the Talbot County Sheriff's Office and the Easton Police Department.Turning to the skies, the Easton Airport's runway improvement program is receiving $525,000 from the Maryland Aviation Administration to support the initial phase of construction.THINKING DOWN THE ROADLocal officials also weighed in on a number of priorities and problem areas they hope the transportation agency will address in the future.Discussions on traffic surrounding the proposed new regional medical center site off of Route 50 were top priorities for state legislators, the county and the Town of Easton. Rick Van Emburgh, Easton's town engineer, said he wanted to work with the county and the state on a regional traffic plan to handle the impact on local roads and infrastructure.Cheryl Lewis, Oxford's town manager, raised questions on the agency's response to flooding on the causeway and pedestrian safety in a town with few sidewalks.Queen Anne Mayor Philip Starkey asked if the agency would reevaluate fixing the bridge between the towns of Queen Anne and Hillsboro, which floods every time it rains, he said.Accessibility was raised as an issue in St. Michaels. According to Town Administrator Rob Straebel, all but one of the town's ADA ramps are not in compliance due to poor work from a contractor.\"I'm not sure what the way forward is, and I'm not here to point fingers or to blame anyone or to place culpability on anyone,\" he said. \"But there really needs to be a sense of urgency to get this project rectified as soon as possible before our tourist season starts in the summer of 2024.\" Pines said the state was working to develop an \"aggressive schedule\" to get the project over the finish line.Sen. Johnny Mautz (R-37) further emphasized the need to fix the ramps, noting that Route 33, as the main road running through St. Michaels, doesn't just serve town residents, but residents of Claiborne, McDaniel, Sherwood and Tilghman.Several Royal Oak residents in attendance also raised concerns about the width and safety of Route 329 (Royal Oak Road), asking the transportation officials to lower the speed limit.\"I wish I could do everything that everyone asked immediately, but we will keep chipping away,\" Wiedefeld said, closing out the meeting. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nState transportation officials take turns sharing updates from their respective agencies on Talbot County projects during a meeting Tuesday, Nov. 7. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Four World War II chaplains honored at American Legion\n\n February 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 349\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — There was reverence and patriotism ringing across a room full of veterans at American Legion Post 70 Sunday as the group gathered to honor four chaplains who gave the ultimate sacrifice.The program, held annually by the American Legion, marks the anniversary of the Feb. 3, 1943, sinking of the U.S.A.T. Dorchester. The ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat shortly after midnight, just 90 miles short of its destination.\nAboard were four chaplains, George L. Fox, Alexander D. Goode, Clark V. Poling and John P. Washington, who gave up their life jackets to save the lives of four servicemen.\n\"They didn't have life jackets when they went down with the ship,\" American Legion Post Cmdr. Wayne Hall said to those gathered Sunday. \"The story goes that they were all holding hands and singing hymns when the ship went down.\"\nDuring the service, the four chaplains were represented by local religious leaders — Rabbi Peter Hyman of Temple B'nai Israel, the Rev. Jonathon Moyers of Grace Lutheran, the Rev. Gary L. Moore of the Trappe Faith Chapel United Methodist Church and the Rev. Michael Angeloni of Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church.\nThe JROTC from Easton High School presented the colors.\nAfter the color guard cleared, the four religious leaders took turns coming to a lectern up in front of the room. They told narratives that fleshed out the four men who gave their lives on that ship.\nAfter they were finished, a citation from U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) was presented to Post 77 and Post 70 for honoring the four chaplains.\n\"It is an important way for the community and society to make sure that the veterans know that their sacrifice and their effort has been appreciated,\" said local veteran and community liaison for Rep. Andy Haris Mike Detmer, who served in Falluhah during the Iraq War.\n\"I do a lot of invocations and benedictions at services,\" said Paula Grimes, Department of Maryland chaplain for the American Legion. \"It is from the heart. It is important to spread the word of the sacrifice about these four gentlemen. Everyone should know the story.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Americans must speak out\n\n March 15, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 381\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Last Saturday night, the Trump regime used ICE to illegally detain Mahmoud Khalil (a green card holder) without warrant or charge, to try to arrest his pregnant wife and to kidnap Khalil to an undisclosed location it refused to share with his family. This illegal, terrorizing behavior would be expected from a dictatorship but not from our government.Any doubt as to the in terrorem role ICE would serve for the Trump regime is quickly vanishing. ICE is for Trump what the Gestapo was for Hitler, a force to stifle opposition with threats, force and torture.\nKhalil has no criminal record. All he did was to exercise his Constitutional rights by organizing peaceful protests at Columbia that opposed continued funding for Netanyahu as Netanyahu committed well-documented war crimes against Palestinians.\nWhen confronted, ICE first claimed Khalil's visa was being revoked but, when informed that he has a green card, changed its story to state his green card was being revoked. However, the decision to revoke a green card can only be made by an immigration judge after the government procures a warrant, makes a legal arrest, files charges, tries the person, convicts the person and allows that person to exhaust all appeals.\nInstead of allowing the due process our Constitution affords every person – citizen or not – the Trump regime executed an autocratic move to stifle dissent and disappear a dissenter that resembles the manner in which Putin deals with dissenters in Russia. This amounts to government terrorism and follows the Trump regime's open repression of student activism and political speech, in this instance criticism of Israel and Netanyahu. Thus, the Trump regime has shown it will use immigration to suppress free speech.\nIf Columbia secretly colluded with the Trump regime in the arrest, it may be a result of the regime's recent cancellation of $400 million in grants and contracts. Trump proved that he is willing to use extortion to achieve personal goals when threatened to withhold funding to force Ukraine to announce an investigation of Biden, so it is not surprising that Trump would use extortion to force colleges to kowtow to his wishes to silence dissent by wrongfully withholding the funds they are entitled to receive, but it is chilling.\nAmericans must speak out against this brutal and illegal conduct.\nJACK L.

I've noticed that when my sawyer, he's cutting a tree, and the tree is really beautiful, everybody feels really good. Then when we get to a tree where the tree is kind of diseased and rotten, the mood kind of changes.\n\"I said to my sawyer, I said, 'Isn't that interesting when you have a tree that is all good and healthy and beautiful, your energy is good and positive. When you get a tree that's all diseased and rotten inside, you might be blaming it on something.' Isn't it interesting that you're exposing the energy of the tree and you're really receiving what is happening within the tree.\"\nVoss hopes Woodhenge will make visitors think and feel emotions and energy from the tree.\nAccording to Abby Lorenz, director of public engagement for Adkins Arboretum, conversations with Voss went on a for long time, but the energy shifted on the project after receiving a grant in July.\n\"More recently the energy and movement around this project is through a Public Arts Planning Grant with Maryland State Arts Council,\" Lorenz said. \"He received a grant funding to focus on the planning of the installation, so right now we have created a survey for people to give feedback on what they think on the project. So I think that's a big part of what we're looking for because this is not just art for artists, it's public art.\"\nThe next step for Woodhenge is applying for a second grant for $30,000 in the fall to begin construction, but according to Voss, they will need to do some fundraising to complete the $75,000 project.\nLorenz said the focus right now is informing the community about the project and getting their thoughts and ideas.\n\"We just recently had a community meeting where we invited people that had knowledge of Stonehenge and cultural landscapes to come together and give their feedback and ideas, and Vico shared his plan and intention of really opening one tree so that you feel like you're inside of one tree,\" Lorenz said.\nAt the feedback meeting, residents shared on how they felt visiting Stonehenge and how that same feeling and cultural significance can be conveyed in a tree landscape.\n\"I think there's excitement, there's intrigue and in a way that people are interested in really what does it mean,\" Lorenz said.\nWhile there is no set timeline for the project, Lorenz and Voss believe Woodhenge will be built and open to the public in 2026 or 2027.\nWoodhenge would sit on Nancy's Meadow on the north side of the Adkins Arboretum property. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One of the most reliable is that if one side is playing on a suit, it is wrong for the other side to play on it too.Today's deal is a straightforward example.West leads his fourthhighest heart against three no-trump. This gives declarer seven top tricks: two spades, one heart, three diamonds and one club. Assuming no 4-0 diamond split, two more tricks are readily available in diamonds. Or are they? Look at the spots. If the diamonds break 3-1, declarer will have to win the fourth round in his hand. With no dummy entry, the fifth diamond trick shrivels and dies like an earthworm on a hot pavement.However, South spotted a possibility. After winning the first trick with dummy's heart nine, he cashed the diamond queen and ace.West's club discard was a blow, but now declarer led the heart king.You see the idea behind this play. South knew West had started with at most five hearts, because West had led the five and declarer could see the three and four. South hoped that West would cash at least one more heart trick, on which the declarer would discard the blocking diamond seven or nine.However, West knew that if South thought it was right for North-South to play on hearts, it had to be wrong for East-West to do so too. West won with the heart ace and immediately switched to a spade.This condemned the contract. When declarer lost a trick in another suit, the defenders cashed their hearts. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He said the threat is a photo of a \"clearly\" photoshopped Instagram message that includes the 410 area code.\n\"We're taking it very seriously, as we do every threat,\" Gamble said, adding that, through investigation, the Sheriff's Office doesn't think there is \"any viable threat to the safety\" of TCPS students.\nAccording to a letter from the district addressed to TCPS families, the district is \"closely monitoring the situation\" and working with local authorities. The letter says that school operations will continue as normal.\nGamble said a criminal investigation by the Sheriff's Office is underway. He said all school resource officers in the district are aware of the threat, and extra deputies are patrolling.\nOn Friday, TCPS students were put in a modified lockdown following a threatening social media post made that morning. According to the Sheriff's Office, the threat originated outside of the United States and similar threats were made to schools in Easton, Pennsylvania.\nGamble said the Sheriff's officer is aware of jurisdictions in other states that \"have had 40 or 50 of these types of threats.\"\n\"It's happening all over our country where, for whatever reason, somebody is trying to disrupt school operations and put our kids in fear,\" he said.\nGamble said that a few years back, the district experienced something similar where about half a dozen non-specific threats were made during the course of the school year. He said he would expect to see more of these threats this year.\n\"This just seems like the thing to do these days for some reason,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's the plastic bottles the water comes in that are potentially harmful to our health and environment.The folks at the Mayo Clinic say we need to be concerned about BPA.Exposure to BPA, they say, is a concern because of possible health effects on the brain, behavior and prostate gland of fetuses, infants and children. The Food and Drug Administration suggests that very low-level exposure to BPA is safe; however, the agency is engaged in ongoing research. Sounds scary to me.Health issues are one thing, but the effect on the environment is another.According to the Environmental Protection Agency, in 2018, the U.S. generated nearly 36 million tons of plastic waste. This has been a problem for so long that Concord, Massachusetts, in 2012 became the first municipality in the nation to ban the sale of single-serving water bottles. San Francisco in 2014 implemented one of the strictest bottled water bans in the country by banning the sale of bottled water on public property.Extreme reactions? Perhaps, but 36 million tons of plastic waste is no small matter.If health and environment issues aren't enough to give us pause, consider that single-serve bottled water is not that great for our wealth, either. Do the math. It all adds up.Every day I fill my water bottle at least three times (it has a 24-ounce capacity). I find that I drink a lot more water just because this particular container is convenient, BPA-free and pretty cool, too. What do I like most about it? I don't have to tip it up to drink from it.Think of an adult \"sippy cup\" with a built-in straw and flip top.Mary Hunt is the founder of EverydayCheapskate.com, a frugal living blog, and the author of the book \"Debt-Proof Living.\" COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n \n Caption: MARY HUNT \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Striped bass limits will protect their future\n\n May 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: ALLISON COLDEN | Section: Columns \n \n 702\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This season anglers and commercial fishermen are following new striped bass limits in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic Coast.There's good reason.\nPersistent concerns about low striped bass numbers led Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission this May to take additional steps to address the number of striped bass that are dying after being caught and released, as well as unsustainable commercial fishing rates.\nThe commission's latest steps aim to get rebuilding efforts back on track. We must face the hard truth that striped bass are struggling. Concerns stem from below average numbers recorded over last five years by Maryland's juvenile striped bass survey — an annual count of the number of young striped bass in Chesapeake tributaries. The 2023 count was dismal — the second-lowest since the survey began in 1957.\nThe Bay's commercial striped bass catch has seen a decline of about 40 percent from 2012 to 2022. Maryland and Virginia's commercial harvest totaled 4.5 million pounds in 2012 and just 2.7 million pounds in 2022, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThese numbers make it clear: Without action now, there might not be a striped bass fishery in the future.\nNEW LIMITS\nTo address population concerns, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission's Striped Bass Management Board voted at its spring meeting to establish a workgroup to reduce catch and release mortality. The workgroup will explore the effectiveness of season closures, impacts of different types of fishing tackle and the reduction in fishing effort needed to reduce striped bass losses.\nEarlier this year, Maryland implemented emergency regulations to prohibit fishing for striped bass during crucial spring spawning times (April 1 through May 15). The state also closed fishing for striped bass during two weeks in late July, when fish are most likely to get stressed and die after release.\nTo meet additional the commission's requirements, all Atlantic Coast states implemented a one-fish limit for recreational anglers. In the Chesapeake Bay, keepers must measure between 19 and 24 inches.\nStates also implemented a 7 percent reduction in the commercial harvest.\nLEAVE THE BIG FISH\nWhat has everyone so concerned is the lack of smaller striped bass present in the Bay. The last time we saw a strong group of young striped bass was back in 2015 — which are the big fish being caught today. We must leave these fish in the water to reproduce and rebuild the striped bass population. As a recent Maryland DNR study shows, older, larger female striped bass produce far more eggs. There's extra risk in hot months when the water is warm and holds less oxygen, making catch and release mortality rates are high. When air temperatures are above 95 degrees, about 17 percent of shallow hooked striped bass died after release, according to a Maryland DNR study.\nAnglers in Maryland who care about striped bass can take the following steps to help ensure the fishery's future:\nAvoid targeting striped bass during summer (June through August) when high water temperatures stress fish and make them less likely to survive being caught. Anglers can reference Maryland DNR's Striped Bass Advisory Forecast to determine if air and water temperatures are safe.Practice careful catch and release tactics, such as using barbless circle hooks, keeping fish in the water, and supporting fish with two hands if handling.Try fishing for other species, such as invasives like blue catfish or snakehead. The upper Bay and its tributaries are prime for targeting pickerel, white perch, and yellow perch. In higher salinity areas, anglers can target cobia, red drum, speckled trout, Spanish mackerel, and many other species.\n1980s MORATORIUM\nForty years ago, striped bass numbers reached a crisis point. Fishery regulators implemented a moratorium that shut down Maryland's striped bass fishery from 1985 to 1989. Striped bass numbers rebounded through the 1990s, and the moratorium is considered a major success story for fisheries management.\nBut there are new factors challenging the current recovery of striped bass, including climate change, pollution, habitat loss, invasive species and overfishing. New fishing limits are one of the most immediate, effective actions that can be taken to rebuild striped bass numbers.\nMaking these sacrifices today will help us avoid another moratorium and ensure that the striped bass fishery has a future.\nAllison Colden is the Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Gag order in Trump trial is wrong - COMMENTARY\n\n October 20, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: David Harsanyi | Page: 6 | Section: Opinions \n \n 704\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n This week, U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan overseeing United States v. Donald Trump issued a gag order prohibiting a leading presidential candidate, Donald Trump, from engaging in speech aimed at \"government staff,\" among others, during his trial.Listen, I understand the disdain some conservatives feel for the former president. I share the sentiment.But if you're cheering on a judge who's inhibiting political speech on rickety grounds, you're no friend of \"democracy\" or the Constitution.\"Mr. Trump may still vigorously seek public support as a presidential candidate, debate policies and people related to that candidacy, criticize the current administration and assert his belief that this prosecution is politically motivated,\" Chutkan explained. \"But those critical First Amendment freedoms do not allow him to launch a pre-trial smear campaign against participating government staff, their families and foreseeable witnesses.\"Who is Chutkan to dictate the contours of a presidential candidate's political speech? What if one of the \"participating government staff\" or a family member is compromised by partisanship?Moreover, preemptively suggesting that without gagging, Trump will engage in a \"smear campaign\" is as prejudicial to the case as any of the inflammatory things Trump has thrown around. It implies that any accusation now aimed at prosecutors is untrue.Trump contends that he is being railroaded by special counsel Jack Smith, the longtime federal prosecutor who works on behalf of Democrats and President Joe Biden. You might believe the special counsel is a chaste defender of Lady Justice, but there's ample evidence that partisan considerations are in play. Fears of a politicized Justice Department are real. As we speak, the head of the Democratic Party is being mollycoddled by the state in a very similar case involving classified documents.Whatever the case, the Justice Department now plays a big part in Trump's campaign for the presidency - and probably his legal case, as well.If the state's accusations can be spread throughout the media before a trial, why can't the defendant speak openly, as well?In the name of fairness, Chutkan contends that Trump does not enjoy unfettered First Amendment rights because he might intimidate witnesses.It's already illegal to intimidate witnesses.Charge him if he does it. Laws already exist to cover all the other premises Smith has used to rationalize the gag order.The notion that a jury pool is going to be impartial in a trial involving a divisive former president, who is not only a leading contender for the presidency but one of the most famous people on Earth, is absurd. And the notion a D.C. jury pool will be impartial when it comes to Trump is fantastical. There is little that can be done about it. But further gagging the defendant only feeds, at the very minimum, the perception that this is all politically motivated.Establishment media informs us that the gag order is just \"narrow\" and meant to \"protect the integrity of the trial and the jury pool.\" In her Solomonic wisdom, Chutkan cut the state's request in half. A \"narrow\" gag order limiting free speech is still a gag order limiting free speech. The fact that Smith was seeking even broader limitations only makes Trump's claims more plausible.Smith has argued that Trump should not be afforded \"special treatment\" because he's a candidate. He's right. No one's right to defend themselves or to engage in speech should be inhibited, not even during trials (though any good lawyer will tell clients, for their own good, to shut up). Still, gag orders are almost always an unconstitutional prior restraint. For years, the American Civil Liberties Union and similar groups argued the same.I'm sure many people simply believe Trump deserves it. Think, though, about the precedent: Administrations can now launch prosecutions against political rivals - calibrated to take place in favorable cities and timed to coincide with elections - and then demand gag orders be implemented on those running for office. If you think they won't do it to others, you haven't been paying attention.David Harsanyi is a senior editor at The Federalist.

    "content": "A battle royal at the library\n\n February 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Life \n \n 810\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I'm pretty sure I have William Shakespeare and Bernard Cornwell to thank for the fact the battle of Agincourt has long fascinated me, for it was after I read Cornwell's novel of the same title and saw Shakespeare's \"Henry V\" that I began to seriously ponder that battle's many imponderables. These are, in no particular order:In 1415, Henry V of England attacked France. His first goal, the seizure of the fortified town of Harfleur, took much longer than expected. By the time the city's garrison surrendered, Henry had lost a sizable number of his troops to disease, probably cholera.\nNow, knowing that the king of France had sent a great host to drive the English from his realm, Henry's only hope—if he was to avoid the destruction of his army and his own capture and imprisonment—was to race all the way across northern France toward the safety of the English-held town of Calais.\nBut before he set off on this desperate march through miserable weather, he had to weaken his army even further by leaving enough men behind to defend Harfleur, the prize won at such great cost.\nFor a while the two armies played cat and mouse, but, eventually, near a village called Agincourt, the French managed to place their much larger force between the English and the road to Calais.\nBy this time the English force was on half-rations, so the soldiers that faced the French the next the morning (Oct. 25, 1415) were hungry, exhausted and riven by disease (it is believed that the dysentery was so bad among Henry's troops that some of them went into action that day sans culotte).\nLooking at the odds—a well-fed, armor-clad French army of at least 15,000 men against an English force of, at best, 7,000, all of them half-starved and some half-naked—it's easy to see why everyone expected a great slaughter of Englishmen.\nYet the English not only carried the day, they killed so many Frenchmen that it took that country's nobility nearly a century to recover its numbers and sort out the property transfers necessitated by so great a mortality.\nAuthorities disagree on the precise numbers, but there is no doubt that thousands of Frenchmen died that day, while contemporaneous accounts claim only 30 English dead.\nThousands vs. 30. You would have thought Henry V had machine guns at his disposal, not bows and arrows.\nAnd if such a lopsided English victory isn't enough to make you scratch your head in wonder, there's one final conundrum that never fails to intrigue me: despite numerous attempts to do so, no archaeological evidence of the battle has ever been found—no hastily dug graves, no broken sword hilts, no dented helmets, not even so much as a thrown horseshoe.\nDespite the fact that, for centuries to come, the British would celebrate the victory and the French lament it, as far as professional archaeology is concerned, it never took place.\nAnd so it was that, when I learned Michael Livingston, a professor at The Citadel, had written a new book about the battle, I immediately did two things: (1) I used the \"Suggest a Title\" option on the Talbot County Free Library's website to ask our acquisitions librarian to purchase a copy for Talbot's collection, and (2) using our inter-library loan system, I ordered a copy for myself from the Anne Arundel County Public Library.\nI won't give away any of his conclusions, but I can tell you Livingston's exhaustive research has led him to propose a new site for the location of the battle (which, if he's correct, should solve the missing artifacts dilemma) and an English battle plan that helps explain Henry's improbable victory without making the French look like fools.\nBut Livingston's book does more than just solve the many mysteries surrounding Agincourt.\nIt ends up being an extended lesson in not just history but the making of history: how we study the past; how, in telling and retelling it, various biases inevitably slip into the narrative and how our view of the past is just as inevitably colored by our present, the intellectual paradigm that structures our study.\nPerhaps just as interesting, and far more disturbing, the book—which spares none of the senses in describing close quarters combat between men wielding axes, hammers, halberds and flails—makes us wonder, yet again, how rational human beings can so willingly engage in war (it was the older men, the veterans who had already experienced such battles, who were the most eager that day to enter the fray).\nFinally, Livingston's \"Agincourt: Battle of the Scarred King\" is a good story, well told. I brought the thing home from the library on a Friday and finished reading it before the fire on Sunday afternoon.\nBy the time this column is published, the Talbot County Free Library will own its own copy of Livingston's book. You should be able to find it on the New Books shelf at 944.0254 LIVI. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Together with their daughter Quin Warner and son-in-law Andy Warner, they transformed the hotel into a thriving family business venture.\n\"Well, we don't know how to have dinner together and not talk about work. But it's enjoyable,\" Quin Warner said. \"We all have the same vision… we're fully ingrained. We love it. And we have ideas, and it's just how we're going to execute these ideas. We all balance each other out, too.\"\nQuin Warner functions as business manager, and Andy Warner acts as general manager. Together, they balance all the weddings and significant events that keep the hotel booked.\nThe recently renovated Oaks Hotel dates back to the 17th Century. The entire plot consisted of 740 acres, and over the years, the property transformed into a premier waterfront venue for wedding receptions.\nIncluded in the renovation were interior and exterior changes to the main building. An additional four cottages were built on the property, and over 200 mature trees were planted.\nBut most importantly, the hotel's owners said, they sought ways to improve accessibility. Scott Wagner explained that they wanted to provide ways for potential grandparents to enjoy the weddings and family reunions often booked on the property.\nThey installed an elevator, created accessible handicap rooms and renovated the dock to make it easier to use for everyone.\nTracy Wagner describes the vision for the hotel as being comfortable and a fun place to welcome guests and locals alike.\nAndy Warner said the community has embraced them, and they have enjoyed hosting events for locals, including holding Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, hosting burger nights and galas, and opening the restaurant and bar to locals on Wednesday and Thursday nights.\n\"We have the best burgers in town, by the way,\" Andy Warner said, beaming with pride.\nLast December, they hosted a Christmas party of between 350 and 400 people. Scott Wagner described the experience as akin to a reunion. Contractors, families, friends and people from every walk of life joined in the fun.\nOverall, the owners look forward to having guests discover the beauty of the Eastern Shore. Whether walking through St. Michaels and Oxford or biking through nature, there's something for everyone, they said.\n\"We've done this for you. We've done this for Talbot County,\" Tracy said. \"We've done this for the brides, for the parents of the bride. And we are proud of this. And we are proud that we've had this opportunity to bring this to Talbot County and to keep this historical place. We've given it a whole new life.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

This includes prepayments and covering for anticipated overages.\nJones asked for approval to transfer $75,000 to student services, in part for prepayments on software, and $500,000 to transportation to prepay upcoming bus lease payments.\nThe district also asked to transfer $600,000 to fixed charges for other postemployment benefits contributions and health insurance prepayments.\n\"We're just trying to make headway there because we're very far behind on that liability,\" Jones said of the benefits payments.\nTo balance the budget, Jones requested that savings from three categories — instructional salaries, special education and interfund transfer to capital projects — be used to transfer the funds. Notably, there was $850,000 saved in instructional salaries.\n\"Whenever we're transferring out of instructional salaries, it always raises an eyebrow,\" Council Vice President Pete Lesher said. \"Because of course that savings comes from vacant positions.\"\n\" … I'm curious what the plan is to fill those positions for the coming years so that we don't see that loss in direct student contact,\" Lesher said.\nJones said the district has a director of recruitment and retention. She also mentioned that having mentors for teachers has been \"very helpful for retention of newly-hired staff.\"\n\"I think a little bit of the savings are a reflection of us having grant availability this year,\" Jones added. \" … If money frees up in a grant and it's appropriate to charge a teacher or part of a teacher salary, we're going to use that money.\"\n\"It's comforting to know that you're being intentional about ensuring that those positions will get filled,\" Lesher said. \" … The success of the schools is one of our most powerful economic development tools. When the schools succeed, it helps all the other businesses, everybody else who's looking to hire in this community.\"\nThe council approved the request unanimously. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Oh, wait, Trump never conquered Europe nor invaded Russia like Napoleon, leading to the deaths of 6.5 million people.\nWhat about Stalin at the 12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party in April 1923 in Moscow? Oh, that won't work either, since Stalin has been blamed for the deaths of 10 million people, maybe more, they don't know for sure. What about Mao at Tian'anmen on October 1, 1949? Oh no, because they now think that Mao and his policies may be responsible for 80 million fatalities; no one knows the exact amount.\nThe only similar number of deaths that we have had in America since Trump first won the 2016 election is the number of babies aborted, which is in the millions. But they don't count, do they? Plus abortion is not Trump's fault, although if Democrats did not love abortion they would find a way to blame him for it, as they do other things.\nSo please stop comparing Trump to a mass murderer like Hitler. It does not insult Trump because it is so absurd, but it does diminish the real victims of the real Nazis, whose bodies are still being recovered in mass graves throughout Eastern Europe.\nAs for the complaint about Trump's executive orders, what about all the executive orders given by Obama and Biden? So Democrat presidents can issue executive orders but when Trump does it somehow the Constitution is being violated? I say to all Democrats, especially to Gov. Wes Moore and his lament over the \"chaos\" in Washington (Star Democrat, Feb. 5), please focus on fixing the chaos your policies have caused in our schools and in our cities, where too often violence reigns.\nMARY-EILEEN RUSSELL\nClaiborne \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Specific costs include contributions to teacher pensions and the state Department of Assessments and Taxation.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher said it's \"simply a poor and inappropriate strategy for resolving the very real state budget crisis.\"\nLesher noted Tuesday that Talbot County isn't seeing the worst of the cost shifts — Dorchester County may be looking at more than $3 million affected, he said.\nDorchester County Council President Lenny Pfeffer said he testified at a Senate budget committee meeting in Annapolis and talked with members of the governor's staff.\nPfeffer says Department of Legislative Services recommendations to double the costs for counties to pay toward teacher pensions is particularly alarming. For Dorchester, it would cost $1.1 million compared to the previously estimated $550,000.\nGov. Wes Moore has said solving the budget crisis is an \"enormous task\" only made more difficult by constraints from the federal government. At a Feb. 28 Senate budget committee hearing, he emphasized that the budget bill is nowhere near final.\n\"While I still remain locked in on the destination, I come in moving in partnership to be flexible on the journey,\" Moore said.\nCaroline County Commissioners President Travis Breeding said the county may lose $1.1 million in income tax revenue if Moore's tax cut plan is approved.\nMoore has maintained that giving middle-class families tax relief is a critical component to the budget and state's economic growth plan.\n\"Marylanders are being squeezed. They're being squeezed by rising prices,\" Moore said Feb. 28. \"They're being squeezed by the rising cost of groceries, they're being squeezed by the rising cost of energy.\"\nAs session continues, Breeding says Caroline County has representatives in Annapolis fighting for relief from the potential cost shifts.\n\"We have a lot of heartburn with the proposed budget,\" Breeding said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So let's gather into a huddle, wrap our arms around one another and take a collective deep breath.Dear Cheapskate: My comment is in response to \"Where to Keep Money for Mom?\" and Bonita in South Dakota, who was looking for input on how to invest $10,000 for her 62-year-old mother who has no savings, no life insurance and lives on disability.I would recommend they go to any funeral home and work with the person there who handles prepaid funerals.Essentially, you are purchasing an insurance policy to cover the funeral costs.We did this for my dad before he moved into a longterm care facility, which was going to drain his remaining assets to $0. A prepaid funeral policy is excluded from the asset base, is protected once the assets are gone and a person goes on medical assistance.With all the other drama that comes with aging parents, it is nice for my sister and me to know that the end is covered and won't create another drain/strain on everything. - Molly Dear Molly: Thanks for this wise advice. In fact, many elder law attorneys advise prepayment as a way to invest in assets that will not be countable by Medicaid or SSI.However, I want my readers to know that there are pitfalls on the road to prepaid end-of-life arrangements, which they need to know about in order to avoid falling into them.

    "content": "Chesapeake Bay cleanup at a crossroads: new path or stay the course?\n\n October 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JEREMY COX Bay Journal | Section: State News \n \n 1014\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As the Chesapeake Bay cleanup's leaders close in on a revised working agreement, many of the effort's most influential supporters are endorsing a major thematic shift: putting less emphasis on improving the estuary's seldom-seen deep waters and more on helping people and living resources in the Bay watershed.\"This is an opportunity for our movement to understand our successes and failures, and adjust accordingly,\" said Kate Fritz, CEO of the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay, in a letter to the Chesapeake Bay Program, the multi-state and federal partnership in charge of reviving the Bay. \"This means … intentionally including people and living resources at the center of the partnership's work.\"\nThat closely aligns with the recommendations of the Bay Program team that was tasked with drafting an update of the 2014 Chesapeake Bay Agreement. A draft was released for public feedback on July 1.\nThe team urged the program to \"better incentivize practices that maximize benefits to living resources and people.\" This, they argued, could be accomplished largely through actions that target water quality improvements — long the effort's central focus — but only if local community concerns take precedent.\nMore than 80 people and organizations submitted comments on the draft agreement by the Aug. 30 deadline. The Chesapeake Executive Council — the governors of the six watershed states, mayor of the District of Columbia, chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission and administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency — is set to vote on a final draft during its annual meeting in December.\nThe revised agreement is intended to serve as a top-line strategy for cleaning up the Bay and its 64,000-square-mile drainage basin beyond 2025, when the deadline for goals in the current agreement expires.\nFor decades, the partnership has centered its work on reducing nutrient and sediment pollution flowing into the Bay. The main goal has been to shrink the annual \"dead zones,\" pockets of oxygen-starved water in the estuary's deepest waters where aquatic creatures struggle to survive.\nDespite billions of dollars invested in the effort, pollution reductions have been modest and slow in coming, according to the Bay Program's own calculations. Some advocates and scientists fear that the cleanup risks falling out of favor with the public if it doesn't shift toward more visible quests, such as restoring shallow waters along the edge of the Bay and its tributaries.\n\"Without renewed attention to those things that matter the most to people, we run the risk of leaving potential living resource benefits unaddressed and potentially losing public support for our efforts,\" wrote Larry Sanford, chair of the Bay Program's Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), on behalf of the panel.\nBut in remarks to STAC on Sept. 12, Sanford, a professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, described the new draft agreement as a \"compromise\" between two factions: those seeking a pronounced change in direction and those who want to stay the course.\nFor his part, Sanford said the program needs to maintain much of its existing work but also \"go back to the original reason for the Bay Program, and that was what was happening to the living resources.\"\nIf that recalibration is to move forward, it will have to survive a big test later this fall when the agreement goes before the Principals' Staff Committee — senior officials from the Bay states and DC, who sounded a note of caution about that approach when they met in March.\nMeeting water quality goals is a legal requirement, enforced by the EPA. The committee appeared concerned that de-stressing that goal could lead to potential lawsuits. Several members at the time also said they believed that those authoring the revised agreement had gone beyond what they had been authorized to do.\nA group of agricultural industry groups in Virginia, including the Virginia Farm Bureau, signed on to a letter that said they \"appreciate\" the draft's call to better address climate change and public engagement. But they are concerned that such measures would \"change the original intent and shared goals\" of the 2014 agreement. The state in its current two-year budget has set aside a record $207 million to reduce farm-based pollution.\nMeanwhile, several environmental groups touted how reorienting the program toward people and living creatures would support other important goals. Much could be achieved, for example, through tougher enforcement of state and federal water pollution control laws, according to a letter signed by Waterkeepers Chesapeake and several local waterkeepers.\n\"While the status quo elevates considerations of nutrient pollutants and the dissolved oxygen levels in the mainstem of the Bay, the path forward must elevate the role that enforcement of illegal pollution from point sources has on protecting humans and wildlife from toxic and carcinogenic substances,\" the waterkeepers said.\nThe needs of people and wildlife will be difficult to meet without more land conservation, said the Chesapeake Conservation Partnership, an alliance of land trusts and related organizations. Bay leaders, they added, should elevate land conservation to stand as a \"key guiding pillar\" along those already on that top tier: science, restoration and partnership.\nThe document being readied for the Executive Council's approval this December isn't the final revised agreement but rather a framework for a more detailed compact to be worked out in the future. The current draft doesn't call for a full revision of the agreement until the council meets in 2026.\nSeveral commenters urged leadership to put the finalized agreement on a faster schedule. To wait until late 2026 could lead to a pause or slowdown in oyster restoration activities in key Bay tributaries, said Oyster Recovery Partnership Executive Director H. Ward Slacum. It should be ready by the end of 2025 instead, he said.\nA group of about 40 retired Bay scientists and former public officials also weighed in. The coalition, calling itself \"Chesapeake Bay Program Veterans,\" echoed the push to have the revisions in place in 2025.\nAnd the program should look at the problems and benefits that arise from local, state and federal greenhouse gas reduction goals, they said. They suggested that the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, for example, is likely to reduce nitrogen pollution that enters Bay waters from the atmosphere. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Band Leader Matt Fullerton keeps all the moving pieces in order.The band brought its music to Thompson Park on Nov. 9 during the Waterfowl Festival, and band members commanded a range from flutes to thundering drums.\nBut the most significant diversity the band exhibits is not in its musical abilities, but in the ages of its members.\nMembers of the band range from high schoolers to those in their upper 70s. There are people from all different walks of life who come together to make music.\n\"We do this because we love music. If nothing else it is therapy. No, it is a lot of fun,\" Fullerton said.\nFullerton has been conducting since 1975 and has a masters in music. He taught the band at Easton Middle school for 30 years. He said he can play most of the instruments in the band.\nTracie Thomas, who plays clarinet, has been in the band since its founding in 2009.\n\"One of the best parts is getting to play with my old musical director from middle school, Matt Fullerton,\" she said. \"Just being able to play is the best part. We generally have a season, and we will have a repertoire for the season that we select for each concert. Of course we already have Christmas music out. We have started rehearsing for that.\"\nShe said they have everything from jazzy Christmas to sleigh ride Christmas music.\n\"We really try hard to be a part of the community. Our band is here to serve other nonprofits like we are today. Every concert we have played is no charge and often raising money for another organization. Everybody here is volunteering their time,\" Thomas said.\nThere was also a vast expanse of musical choices on display at the Nov. 9 concert, including a theme from the Disney film Fantasia \"Night On Bald Mountain,\" a medley of computer gaming songs, a march and a hoedown.\n\"It includes themes from Assassin 33, 'Bratja' from Full Metal Alchemist, 'Dragon Born' from Skyrims, 'Sadness and Sorrow' from Naruto and 'Baba Yetu' from Civilization 4,\" Fullerton said of the gaming medley.\nHe noted that Hollywood used to produce most music, but the successful gaming industry is paying composers to make the digital worlds come alive.\n\"The same backing that creates that, as they do for themes for movies. It is possible that more people hear these than some of the pieces more than some of the movie themes,\" Fullerton said.\nOf course the band also played a crisp \"Star Spangled Banner\" and got the crowd on their feet.\nThey practice at the Easton High band room every Tuesday at 7 p.m. They always looking for new players, even if they haven't dusted off their tuba in 10 years.

I am sure they were not fired for cause. They were fired because Elon Musk was given authority to fire government employees, and he appears to get his gets kicks doing that. (See his chainsaw antics at CPAC.)\nWhere are those two fired scientists going to get private sector jobs? As reported in the Chesapeake Bay Journal March 2025, Trump is destroying all Bay protection agencies. Musk is firing federal scientists everywhere. Will Harris name some private companies that are going to take over protection of the Chesapeake Bay? Tesla? Starlink? Meta? Amazon? Maybe the two Oxford scientists can get jobs at an Amazon warehouse.\nJobs for the thousands of employees working for Veterans Affairs have been targeted for firing. People have been fired from security agencies that protect us from Russia. What companies are going to do that work? United Heath Care? Pfizer? Maybe each person buying Trump's gold card for $5 million to enter the U.S. will be required to adopt two veterans and assign one person to provide cybersecurity for America.\nMr. Harris's answer that private sector jobs will fulfill these requirements is a tragic joke.\nMr. Harris is also quoted as saying what an honor it was for him to sit next to the leader of the free world. That can't be Trump. He directed the U.S. to vote with North Korea, Iran and Russia denying a resolution supporting Ukraine. A prominent Republican of old called North Korea and Iran part of the \"Axis of Evil.\" The free world, they ain't.\nMany countries in the free world are at economic war with us. Our free world friends, such as Canada, are being courted by China to get themselves out of Trump's toxic world order.\nThe free world is divorcing us, and it seems everyone knows that except Mr. Harris.\nIf you disagree with Musk disemboweling the government while gleefully prancing around and ruining lives, and you disagree with Trump catering to Putin while making economic war against allies, vote Harris out in 2026.\nMICHAEL DAVIS\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He fled north in 1838 and changed his name to Frederick Douglass. His brilliance, eloquence and courage, quickly brought him to the forefront of the abolitionist movement.\nHe was known for his skills as an orator, with many of his speeches remembered to this day.\n\"I would say critically important,\" James Young, the event's publicist, said said about Douglass. \"He's one of, if not the most respected and important figures in the history of the region. I think it's important for anybody to know more about his life and his work but especially for people who come from where he came from.\"\nFrederick Douglass Day kicked off with a parade led by Grand Marshal Childlene Brooks, former president of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society. The parade featured local groups including Building African American Minds, Easton High School NJROTC Color Guard, Polaris Village Academy, and the Easton and Oxford Fire Departments and many more.\nThis year, a big focus for the Frederick Douglass Honor Society was getting the younger generation involved in celebrating Douglass.\nGabriella Thompson, the mistress of ceremony, described as a \"ambitious 14-year-old entering her freshman year of high school,\" and Javion Jones, a 15-year-old minister at Union Baptist Church, were some of the youth featured throughout the day.\n\"I would say there has been some effort to get new people involved. As you know, a lot of people on the committee itself are getting up there,\" Young said. \"So it's a thing that we want to keep going for the foreseeable future, and so at some point you've got to bring in some some fresh blood.\"\nMultiple local leaders attended and participated in Frederick Douglass Day.\nJaelon Moaney, vice chair of the Maryland Commission on African American History and Culture, recited a famous speech by Douglass. The honor society believes having connections like Moaney are important for the success of the society and the annual event.\n\"Having that connection to African-American history more broadly, as well as current African-American issues, I think is very important,\" Young said. \"That's also something that we try to focus on with the keynote speaker that we bring every year. It's somebody who can bring a perspective of speaking on Douglas but also how he kind of fits into the history of African-American intellectual philosophy.\"\nIn an email following the event, Moaney emphasized his own Eastern Shore roots, similar to those of Douglass.\n\"I, too, am from and decidedly of Talbot,\" Moaney said. \"The Bailey and Moaney families remain connected today. Although two agitators separated by time, my chest began to swell with inexplicable energy while echoing the words delivered on November 25, 1878 from exactly where he stood nearly two centuries prior. As the country commemorates the semiquincentennial and Talbot reaches its 365th anniversary next year, I'm both troubled and moved by the parallels of reality that this experience has revealed.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It directs how the county will move forward in regard to land use, housing, preservation, transportation and more.\nYelton said the planning and zoning department is looking for the plan to be updated by the fall of 2026.\nCounty Manager Clay Stamp thanked Yelton, Communications Manager Sarah Kilmon and staff for meeting the council's overarching goal of transparency by including the public in the first step of the process.\n\"I'd just like to give a shoutout to staff on this,\" Stamp said. \"Council, you've really kind of created a mandate for staff to try to enhance our transparency and communication with the public.\"\nThe survey can be accessed at surveymonkey.com/r/B83RG3X.

This abandoned prison once held famous criminals like Al Capone and Willie Sutton before closing in 1971 and falling into disrepair.\n\"Visiting Eastern State Penitentiary is like stepping into a real-life horror movie,\" says Partners in Fire owner Melanie Allen. \"The desolate, crumbling halls and long-abandoned rooms hold an unyielding tension.\"\nVisitors can tour the prison year-round. The facility also hosts seasonal Halloween Nights, which feature haunted houses, spine-tingling tours, themed bars, and live entertainment.\nThe House of the Seven Gables, MassachusettsThe House of the Seven Gables, built in 1668, is among Salem's eeriest attractions.

Amp up the scares during your overnight stay with a theatrical séance or nighttime tour.\nLincoln Park Zoo, IllinoisIn addition to the zoo animals you'd expect to see, Lincoln Park Zoo is reportedly home to several spirits. Lincoln Park was once the site of Chicago's official city cemetery, and some say thousands of bodies remain buried there today.\nThe zoo hosted its first official paranormal investigation in 2013 after reports of apparitions and disembodied voices in the Lion and Primate Houses.\nOctober visitors can join an evening Haunted History Tour to learn more about the zoo's hauntings. Wear comfortable shoes like boots to enjoy the eerie surroundings while exploring the zoo after dark.\nOhio State Reformatory, OhioThe historic Ohio State Reformatory operated from 1896 to 1990 and is the ideal destination for supernatural lovers.

The owner, arms company heiress Sarah Winchester, began the bizarre multi-decade renovation following her family's death. She expanded the home to 24,000 square feet, installing 160 bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, and six kitchens.\n\"Doors open to nothing, stairs lead to solid walls, and there seems to be an overall feeling of chaos and unsettling vibes that bothered me when visiting,\" explains Chantelle Kincy of Flannels or Flipflops.\nOver the years, many guests have claimed to see specters and hear footsteps in the Winchester Mystery House. Visitors can see areas of the home on year-round guided tours or embark on a seasonal haunted maze through four of the mansion's floors.\nBonaventure Cemetery, GeorgiaWhile southern Georgia's Bonaventure Cemetery is among the world's most beautiful cemeteries, it's also incredibly unsettling.\n\"It was extremely quiet, and there was an overwhelming feeling of sadness as we walked around,\" Jessy Hamel of Brighter Things shares about her visit.\nVarious local legends surround the cemetery, including voodoo rituals and a child spirit that roams the grounds. In October, the cemetery allows guests to embark on a full moon tour, enhancing the creepy atmosphere.\nThe Conjuring House, Rhode IslandSee the terrifying real-life home that inspired The Conjuring movie universe. The house's haunted history stretches back centuries since its construction in the 1730s.\nIn the 1970s, the Perron family bought the home and immediately started having ghostly run-ins. At one point, famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren took an interest in the house.\nAccording to the Perron family, at least two spirits — a married couple who passed away in the 1800s — haunt the house. Interest in the property spiked following the 2013 release of The Conjuring, a hit horror movie that spawned an entire franchise.\nThe current homeowner offers a variety of spooky experiences, from guided daytime tours to overnight investigations where you can bring a blanket and settle in for a night of ghost-hunting.\nSan Fernando Cathedral, TexasSan Fernando Cathedral, established in 1731, is a beautifully haunting church. It's the oldest of its kind in Texas and is said to be among San Antonio's most haunted locations.\nNumerous bodies lie within the cathedral walls, and visitors have reported spectral sightings of dark silhouettes and mysterious orbs.

Dobson.\nThe A. James Clark Emergency Services Training Campus, located on Mistletoe Drive, will be 7,200 square feet and provide state-of-the-art training opportunities for all first responders.\nAs the rendering showed, a building on the training campus will be named after Paul Prager and his wife, Joanne. The Pragers donated $500,000 to the project.\nForte said Thursday that $4.5 million has been raised in the last two-and-a-half years, nearly all of the project's $5 million goal. Project leaders hope for the campus to open by the end of this year.\n\"(It's) taken many, many years; many, many people; many hours; many ideas,\" Forte said. \" … Raising the money was the hardest thing.\"\nAfter the event, Brown said in an interview he's impressed with the coordination between the different first responder agencies in Talbot County.\n\"Often people think small, rural community on the Eastern Shore, 'how busy does it get?'\" Brown said. \"But clearly the numbers show that they're busy. It's important to stand ready. The facility that is going to be built is going to help them do that.\"\nWhen asked afterward if the First Responders Celebration is becoming a tradition, Prager had no hesitation.\n\"It's gotta be, absolutely,\" Prager said. \"These people do thankless jobs. And there's not a whole lot you can do to enable them to make their lives better. So I think if you at least just say thank you, that goes a long way.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Mary and Joseph ended up in Bethlehem when Jesus was born. They had gone there to pay taxes. Paying taxes is never fun but something we have to do. The place they ended up when Jesus was born was probably not their desired location to bear their first child, but they made the most of the location.\nLocation trips a lot of people up on Christmas. Many have no choice. They will spend Christmas in the nursing home or jail. Many have no options. They may be too elderly or sick to travel. They may not have any place to go. If you have options then be thankful. If you have a place to spend Christmas then this is one of your best gifts of all. Don't fight about the place where you will spend Christmas. Make the best of wherever you end up and celebrate with whoever is around.\nThe presents of Christmas are often stressful. Presents are expensive and often we don't know what to buy and how much to spend. You may have a lot of gifts to buy or maybe you don't have a single person for whom you will buy a gift. If you can afford to buy gifts and want to then enjoy the opportunity. If finances are meager this year, then be honest with yourself and others and say our list and budget is very limited this year. Don't put yourself in financial jeopardy by spending money you don't have. The greatest gift is the baby Jesus. Focusing on Him will bring more peace than a house filled with gifts.\nThe pageantry of Christmas often becomes work. How many lights can you string on your roof or around your shrubbery? I enjoy putting up lights on a warm day but despise taking them down in January. Just remember what goes up must come down, eventually. Try to find a mild weather day, and you won't feel like the grinch.\nThe pressure of Christmas gets to a lot of people. People die in December. Loneliness takes over. Stress becomes paramount. People get depressed. Christmas should never be a time of loneliness, stress or pressure, but it was a difficult time for Mary and Joseph. They were poor people. Bringing a child into the world in a stable would not be considered an option for most of us. Traveling was a hassle and very difficult back then. While they were overjoyed with the baby Jesus, life's circumstances were not easy. Later, they would flee to Egypt for the safety of their family which had to add to their pressure.\nThe person of Christmas must be our focus in order to truly celebrate this season. Let's not lose sight of the main character in the Christmas story. If we do, then we will focus on the place, presents, pageantry and pressures of Christmas. Thus, we will miss out on the real joy that the heavenly host proclaimed to those shepherds watching their sheep.\n\"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.\" (Luke 2:14). \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Save a blue crab, eat a blue catfish\n\n June 6, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 734\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The blue crab population has been struggling. For the last four years, experts say, it has experienced significant declines, negatively affecting the economy and ecology of the Chesapeake Bay.Yet, for some studying blue crab populations, the answer to preserving the species is simple.\nAllison Colden, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation Maryland, said one of the best ways to help preserve and uplift the rise of blue crabs in the Chesapeake Bay is by eating more blue catfish.\nColden explained that blue catfish are an invasive species that has been a primarily threat to the blue crab population on the Eastern Shore.\nHarvesting and eating more blue catfish can help reduce their numbers and alleviate some of the predation pressure blue catfish are placing on important species like blue crabs, allowing blue crabs and other native species a better chance at survival and growing their low population numbers, she said.\nThere is agreement among environmental organizations, political leaders and watermen that creating a more streamlined path from harvesting blue catfish to getting them to market and table is key to getting control of their numbers.\nMany watermen suggest establishing a whole new fishery of blue catfish alongside striped bass, blue crabs, oysters and other Bay produce. But for commercial fishermen, who have the capacity to harvest thousands of pounds of blue catfish, jumping through the regulatory hoops currently in place can be daunting and discouraging.\nTilghman Island Seafood in Talbot County is the only USDA-certified blue catfish processor on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\nAccording to the state's website, Maryland is a prominent producer and processor of seafood and is the national leader in supplying blue crabs. The Chesapeake Bay provides about 50% of the total blue crab harvest in the United States, and each year, the Maryland seafood industry contributes nearly $600 million to the state's economy.\nColden said that 2022 had the lowest number of crabs on record according to a dredge survey by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission and Maryland Department of Natural Resources documenting population growth from 1990 to the present. These numbers have left experts concerned about the species.\n\"What has been concerning over the past couple of years is that we're seeing lower numbers of crabs that are staying low,\" Colden said. \"In particular, the number of juvenile crabs is now at four years in a row below that long-term average, which is a concern because those juvenile crabs, which are sampled in the wintertime, are the ones that grow up to support the blue crab fishery in the fall.\"\nColden said this would mainly affect people who are fishing for crabs. Low numbers would impact the fishery and impact profits.\nAccording to the 2024 dredge, there was a total crab abundance of 317 million blue crabs, a slight decrease from last year's estimated population of 323 million. However, it is still above the 2022 record low of 227 million crabs.\nIn 2024, the adult female crab population decreased to 133 million compared with 152 million last year. According to the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, this number falls far below the target of 215 million adult female crabs needed for a healthy population and sustainable harvest in the Chesapeake Bay.\nJuvenile crab numbers improved slightly compared to 2022 numbers, but the juvenile population remained below average for the fourth year. Male crab numbers decreased from 55 million in 2023 to 46 million in 2024 despite male harvest limits instituted last year.\nChris Moore, executive director of Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said in a statement, \"While juvenile population estimates can vary greatly from year to year, it is encouraging to see a slight increase in this segment of the population. However, given the population estimates from this year's survey, there remains a significant need to continue to protect adult females and critical nursery habitats, like underwater grasses, in order to help ensure better numbers in the future. \"\nColden said she understands that they will not be able to eradicate blue catfish, but eating more of this invasive species would help alleviate factors that are negatively impacting blue crabs, which would give the blue crabs the best chance to bounce back from these low numbers.\n\"The Department of Natural Resources in Maryland is encouraging people to get out and eat catfish; they're delicious to eat, they're fun to fight if you're a recreational or commercial angler, and it will help reduce the impact that they're having on our native species — blue crabs,\" Colden said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trey Rider sentenced to 15 months at detention center for house fire\n\n October 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato | Section: Local News \n \n 590\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Fred \"Trey\" Rider III has been ordered to turn himself into the Talbot County Detention Center on Monday morning to serve 15 months for reckless endangerment. His charges stem from a fire he started at his home in November 2022.At a sentencing hearing Friday, Judge Thomas G. Ross also handed Rider a 20-year sentence for first-degree arson with all but the time he's already served suspended. Rider was given five years of probation with conditions that include attending Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings and completing an abuser intervention program.\nIn August, Rider pleaded guilty to first-degree arson and five counts of reckless endangerment for a fire started at his home in Easton on Nov. 24, 2022. He faced up to 30 years in prison and $50,000 in fines for first-degree arson and up to 25 years in prison and $25,000 in fines for the five counts of reckless endangerment.\nRider had also been charged with second-degree arson, first-degree malicious burning, two counts of arson threat, two counts of malicious destruction of property, obstruction of emergency assistance and two additional counts of reckless endangerment. As part of a plea deal, the state did not prosecute Rider for those nine additional charges.\nForty-five firefighters responded to the fire in Rider's two-story, single-family home at 27930 Peach Orchard Road in Easton. Through investigation, officials classified the fire as incendiary.\nAccording to court documents, Rider's reckless conduct in igniting the house on fire \"clearly\" put the firefighters who responded in danger.\nAt Rider's plea hearing, Talbot County Deputy State's Attorney Joyce Jones said Rider blocked his two driveways with vehicles before setting fire to the house.\nThat night, Rider was located a short distance from his home and transported to the University of Maryland Shore Medical Center at Easton for emergency care. Rider's attorney Christine DuFour said at the plea hearing that Rider was under the influence of alcohol during the incident and had slit his wrists.\nAt the sentencing hearing Friday, Jones asked that Rider's sentencing include incarceration. She said the fire was a planned event, citing threatening texts he sent his wife, Kari Rider, who is currently in the midst of a divorce from Trey Rider.\nAt the sentencing, Kari Rider said the night of the fire has caused her and their two sons lasting emotional and psychological effects. She said she and Trey Rider had been in a \"horribly abusive relationship\" and he had been destroying her things for years.\nA restitution hearing, which Kari Rider asked for Friday, is set to be scheduled after the divorce proceedings.\nDuFour, Trey Rider's attorney, said that over the past seven months, Trey Rider has put in hard work at a recovery center and a sober living home. She said that while he has a ways to go, Rider's goal is to become a sponsor for others struggling with addiction. DuFour said Rider also hopes to participate in reunification therapy with his sons.\nA variety of people gave statements on Rider's character during the sentencing, including friends, family and counselors.\nRider said he was ashamed of his conduct, which has \"caused immense harm and pain\" in the lives of his wife and children. Before apologizing to his family, he said he has \"fallen very far\" and has reached out to get as much support as possible so he can continue down a road of recovery.\nBefore handing down the sentence, Ross called Rider's actions the night of the fire \"calculated,\" \"planned\" and \"self-serving.\" He said Rider has been given opportunities that most people don't get, including getting to begin rehab before being sentenced. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Suicides are at record levels in the U.S.; Men, specifically white men, are driving the wave\n\n August 21, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks; APG National Enterprise Editor | Page: A1 | Section: News \n \n 941\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A record number of Americans killed themselves last year, according to new suicide numbers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.Who is driving the contemporary surge in suicides?\"Middle-age white males,\" said Dr.Caroline Fenkel, chief clinical officer and co-founder of Charlie Health Inc., a Bozeman, Montana-based mental and behavioral health provider specializing in virtual and outpatient care for kids, teens and young adults.Men made up 79.4% of the record 49,449 suicides committed nationally last year, according to the CDC. White men make up 30% of the U.S. population.They accounted for 60% (29,847) of the suicides last year, according to the CDC.Fenkel said men, especially white men, can feel the pressures of societal and throwback gender role expectations - and still not show stigmatized weaknesses of their mental health.Gender roles associated with career expectations in a market-based economy also play a role, Fenkel said, pointing to how society can look down at working class and lower-income men employed in some lower-paying service sector jobs.\"They are constantly told that they should be successful. That they should be making a lot of money. That they should be providing for or having a family,\" Fenkel said.Men tend to use guns to kill themselves compared to women who use other means such as attempting overdoses.\"Women are attempting suicides more often but don't succeed, while men tend to complete suicides at much higher frequency,\" said Dusti Linnell, an associate professor of practice with Oregon State University's College of Health. She helps lead the university's community mental and behavioral health efforts.\"The completions are associated with firearms,\" Linnell said.Guns were used in 54.6% of all U.S. suicides last year, according to the CDC data, outpacing other methods such as poisoning and overdoses (11.6%) and suffocations and self hangings (25.8%).Fenkel said men are more impulsive in their decisions to kill themselves - and are less likely than women to talk about their mental health challenges openly.\"They are really more likely to self-treat and to self medicate with alcohol,\" she said. \"I think they are less likely to ask for help in general.I think asking for help as a male is seen as a weakness.\" UPSETTING UPSWINGSuicides have been on the rise in the U.S. since 2000. There were 29,350 suicides reported by U.S. health agencies in 2000. They have increased 68.4% since then and 4.1% since 2019 before all the stressors and shutdowns of the coronavirus pandemic.The 2022 increases include noticeable jumps from 2021 among those ages 45-64 (6.6%) and 65 and older (8.1%) as well as Asians (5.7%) and Hispanics (4.3%).Those all outpace the overall 2.6% jump in suicides from 2021 to 2022.Linnell said she's seen worrisome increases in suicides and suicide attempts by farmers and others working in rural and outdoor vocations as well as continued mental health stigmas and a pronounced counselor shortages making it difficult for those in need to find help.Farmers, farm workers and others working outside have to deal with extreme weather changes including warmer temperatures as well as pesticides and other chemicals.Linnell said lingering stigmas about talking about mental health and suicidal thoughts can be magnified along with social isolations in smaller towns and rural regions.\"One of the most difficult things to say to another person is that you are thinking of killing yourself or harming yourself,\" she said.Fenkel said the shortage of mental and behavioral health workers is so pronounced that as many 150 million Americans live in \"mental health deserts\" where access to services and treatment can be scarce.SOLUTIONS?So what can be done?The growth of telehealth services born out of and magnified after the pandemic has improved access to mental and behavioral resources and sparked the growth of groups such as Montana-based Charlie Health, which was established in 2020.That can allow more therapists and counselors to live and work in smaller towns and rural areas while also seeing patients in bigger cities.It also can offer some privacy for those with mental and behavioral health challenges they might not trust sharing with family or employers. \"It can be embarrassing,\" Linnell said.She said Oregon State is part of efforts in the Pacific Northwest to implement and grow peer-based mental and behavioral health programs.Whether its middle-age or older men or teenagers, it can be easier to talk about sensitive topics such as suicide and self-harm with a friend than family members or employers.High schools and colleges are implementing peer-based mental health programs.Linnell said Oregon State is looking to grow peer-based \"Mental Health First Aid\" and QPR (Question, Persuade, Refer) programs.The former entails a six-hour training programs to help participants to build skills to help friends and others in need while the other has shorter 90-minute programs aimed suicide prevention.A key goal is for those considering or recovering from self-harm to believe they can get better.\"It's so important for people to know that recovery is possible,\" she said. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/CREATIVE COMMONS/LENART LIPOVŠEK LENART /UNSPLASH.COM\n \nMen made up more than 79% of total suicides in the U.S. last year, according to provisional data from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control. White men, who make up 30% of the total population accounted for 60% of the 49,449 suicides nationally, the agency said.\n \nAP PHOTO/MARK LENNIHAN, FILE\n \nA sculpture called the \"Vessel\" at the Hudson Yards development in New York City saw a series of suicides after opening in 2019. The U.S. saw a record numbers of suicides last year, according to provisional data from the U.S Centers for Disease Control.\n \nThose dealing with suicidal thoughts and mental health crises can call or text 988 for help and resources. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It's the only municipality in Talbot County that does not have one.\n\"This would allow any municipality to have up to one Class E establishment, so that way, residents of Trappe would have the same access to a store that others in the county have,\" he said.\nTown residents currently have to drive to Easton or Cambridge to shop at a liquor store.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher emphasized that the council does not issue liquor licenses — the county liquor board does — but the bill enables that the board to be able to review one for the town.\n\"Without this legislation, a new business would not be possible,\" he said. \"So this is enabling legislation for sure.\"\nThe bill was approved unanimously. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

We are so proud of and inspired by the veterans and service members on our team. This is just a great opportunity to honor them and let them know what they mean, n to us.\"In addition to lighting buildings and other meaningful landmarks, residents, businesses and other organizations are encouraged to participate by simply changing one light bulb in their home to a green bulb.This can be an exterior light that neighbors and passersby see or an interior light that sparks a conversation with friends.\"Operation Green Light is a gesture of support and appreciation for the public service of our veterans,\" said NACo Executive Director Matthew Chase. \"With hundreds of towns and counties coming together to light everything from bridges to courthouses, we know veterans across the country will see and feel the gratitude we all feel for their service and sacrifices.\"Counties and residents across the country are sharing their participation on social media using the hashtag #OperationGreenLight.For more information on Operation Green Light, visit https://veterans.mary-land.go v/op e ration-g reen-light/. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

What is it?The declarer enjoys a considerable advantage during the card-play. To try to balance the books (as my librarian phrases it), a defender makes the opening lead. Sometimes this is critical -- as in today's deal.\nNote that if the declarer plays first in four spades, he can draw trumps immediately, aided by the 2-2 split. Then he cashes his two top hearts and ruffs a heart in the dummy, bringing down West's queen. South graciously concedes three tricks.\nHowever, West made the opening lead tell. He selected the diamond two, which East won with the queen. As West had supported diamonds, East wasn't tempted to try to cash the diamond ace. Even if West had made an eccentric raise on three low diamonds, he would have led his highest diamond, not the two.\nEast switched to the club ace and continued with the club 10. After winning with the king, West saw what was needed to defeat the contract. He led another club, and East didn't let her partner down. She ruffed with the spade queen.\nSouth overruffed with the spade king, but now West had to win a trump trick. The uppercut had been decisively delivered.\nVoltaire said that marriage is the only adventure open to the cowardly. This East and West are not married, but apparently, after the deal was over, West said, \"Well defended, partner. I wish my wife played bridge as well as you do. She would have ruffed with the spade two.\"\nNo, I wasn't West.

    "content": "'Still matters today': Community to read famous Frederick Douglass speech on Saturday\n\n July 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 499\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On July 5, 1852, Frederick Douglass asked a burning question in front of hundreds of abolitionists in Rochester, New York: \"What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?\"The Talbot County native, often considered the most important abolitionist and civil rights leader of his time, delivered an address that described why enslaved African Americans weren't afforded the same freedoms and liberties that could allow them to celebrate the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence like the rest of the nation.\nDouglass' famous speech is still popular 173 years later. On Saturday, the Easton-based Frederick Douglass Honor Society is hosting an annual community reading. Local officials, community leaders, residents and children are reading aloud portions of the address on the lawn of the Talbot County Courthouse starting at 10 a.m.\nVickie Wilson, the society's treasurer, says this year's calendar couldn't have worked out any better, with the event falling on the same day Douglass spoke to the Rochester Ladies Anti-Slavery Society.\n\"What's really exciting for us this year is that the first time Douglass read this speech was on July 5, 1852,\" Wilson said. \"And now, it falls again on July 5.\"\nThe Frederick Douglass Honor Society has held the reading annually since 2018, though it was put on pause last year for a separate event. Wilson says this year's return is exciting due to the diversity of people — in age, race, occupation and more — participating in the reading. Fifty-nine people are expected to step up to the podium.\n\"We live in a diverse community,\" Wilson said. \"It's going to show the love that we have for this community as well.\"\nDouglass in his 1852 speech explained the significantly different perspective enslaved people had on the Fourth of July holiday.\n\"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer; a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim,\" Douglass said.\nHe continued: \"To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciation of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade and solemnity, are, to Him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy — a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages.\"\nWilson says the Talbot County tradition during the week of Independence Day is a moving one. She encourages people, no matter how they celebrate the holiday the rest of the week, to attend on Saturday.\nShe said the speech is a \"lot to unpack,\" but extremely powerful. It still resonates with her today, and she believes it does for many Talbot County residents.\n\"It still matters today,\" Wilson said. \"And I often think it matters more today in the climate that we're in right now. Everything here about this speech is still relevant.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "St. Michaels talks tax rates at commissioners meeting\n\n November 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maggie Trovato; mtrovato@chespub.com | Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 848\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS - At a meeting Wednesday, the Commissioners of St. Michaels spoke about gathering stakeholders to discuss the town's tax rates.The discussion followed an issues brief sent to the commissioners from the St. Michaels Historic District Residents Association.The issues brief argues that St. Michaels, \"a small tourist town with a tourism economy,\" is largely supported by its residents, rather than its businesses.\"The infrastructure needed to support Talbot County's and the town's tourism economy imposes a heavy tax load on St. Michaels homeowners, while those who benefit most are taxed the least, or not at all in the case of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum,\" the issues brief states.At the meeting, Commission President David Breimhurst said he was glad that the Historic District Residents Association is offering to be part of the solution. He suggested getting all stakeholders from every aspect of the community together to talk and see what they can come up with.\"I don't think it needs to be 'us against them' or adversarial in any way,\" he said. \"Just to have a calm, adult discussion about where we stand.\" Dan Spiegel spoke on behalf of the St. Michaels Historic District Residents Association at the meeting Wednesday.He summarized some of the points made in the issues brief and named the four steps the group hopes the commissioners will take:▪ Begin a period of study and assessment of the tax options other towns use to raise revenue from business activities.▪ Engage with the Maritime Museum to urge they make a payment in lieu of taxes to the town.▪ Hold public hearings to discuss any plans that may develop.▪ Look at current residential property rates to determine whether they are \"fair and appropriate,\" in the case that the town raises additional revenue from businesses.Spiegel said that most of the money the town uses to fund services and maintain its infrastructure comes from property taxes.He said that, based on data gathered from the state, there are 81 business structures that pay property taxes in town, compared to 796 homes and non-business structures.\"In other words, only 9% of the property taxes are paid by businesses,\" he said.Spiegel said that although Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum is the \"crown jewel\" of the town's tourist economy, it is tax exempt and does not make any voluntary payments directly to the town. These types of payments are known as payments in lieu of taxes, or PILOTs.\"Many universities and colleges pay PILOTs to towns because of their use of the infrastructure and other things that impact the town,\" he said. \"The museum makes no PILOT payments.\" Spiegel also said money generated by businesses does not stay in the town. He said that 97% of the town's commercial buildings are owned by non-residents and more than 90% of the business operators who rent the buildings are also non-residents.\"So non-resident landlords, business operators and employees spend their money elsewhere because there are very few normal types of businesses that they can spend money on that would attract their dollars,\" he said.After Spiegel spoke, Commissioner Tad DuPont said this conversation has already begun.\"You're stimulating a conversation, but it has started,\" he said.DuPont said that with the changing tourist economy, St.Michaels needs to change with it and be ahead of it.Commission Treasurer Al Mercier said he could envision multiple areas where the town could generate more revenue, including a tourism tax, an alcohol tax, an accommodations tax and parking meters.\"These are nine or 10 things that I think we need to put on the agenda going forward,\" he said.During public comment, Kristen Greenaway, president and CEO of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum, talked about what the museum pays the town, including an annual event fees tax, and what services it offers residents.She said the museum offers free after school and summer programming for local and Talbot County youth, free museum membership for St. Michaels' youth and free entry for locals with passes that can be obtained at the library.Greenaway said the taxes on The Crab Claw restaurant property, which the museum is purchasing, will still be paid, as it will remain zoned as maritime commercial.Spiegel said the Historic District Residents Association is not anti-museum or anti-business.\"This is an informal group of residents that were organized, that live in the historic district, that are concerned about the future of St. Michaels,\" he said.John Marrah, a property owner in St. Michaels, said he enjoyed the Historic District Residents Association presentation.\"It's important that people think they're treated fairly from a taxation standpoint,\" he said.Marrah added that business and property owners are taxed \"with no representation\" in St.Michaels. He said that might be something the town should look into.\"I own properties in town, but since I don't live in town, I can't vote,\" he said. \"I pay property taxes like everybody else.\" \n \n Caption: MAGGIE TROVATO/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nDan Spiegel speaks about St. Michaels tax rates on behalf of the St. Michaels Historic District Residents Association at a Commissioners of St. Michaels meeting on Nov. 8. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

And although no bids were cast, there was a lot of interest in these boats, all of which have been donated to the museum.\nEach boat has a story. Kristen Greenaway, president and chief executive officer of CBMM, knows many of these stories. On Thursday, she noted a little wooden sailboat with a well-maintained sheen. It was designed in the 1930s.\n\"This is a Chesapeake Bay locally designed boat,\" she said. \"The chap who designed it put a couple of designs together. It was great for sailing upwind, and when it was sailing downwind, it would kind of flop from one side to the other. The wife of the chap he asked 'What did it look like?' She said it looked like a penguin waddling from side to side. So he named it 'penguin' and they are all painted with a black hull,\" Greenaway said.\nThe auction has a large reach.\n\"People come from far and wide to come in here and just have a phenomenal day kicking fenders, not kicking tires. And just having fun and maybe finding something to take home,\" she said.\nThis is the first year the museum has implemented reserves, or minimum bids.\nThe range of possibility is staggering. There was a 46-foot trawler with $15,000 minimum. There was jet ski with just 40 hours of running time. There was a whole section of boats at the auction that were floating at the dock. Some of the boats needed some care, but most were ready to hit the water.\nLad Mills, is longtime CBMM worker who retired five years ago. He just came to observe and scope out the offerings for a friend. He had some thoughts as man who helped found the auction event.\n\"You have to have enough, having is cleaned, and presented properly and having the proper crowd. Auctions are fun to watch because people get excited. People get emotional and people don't want anyone else to get their boat,\" Mills said.\n\"It does people a lot of good to be able to get rid of boats they have and don't want. I like old boats. I still fiddle with old boats. I am not a perfectionist, but I like to resurrect boats,\" Mills said.\nThe boat auction is important for the museum, Greenaway said.\n\"The boat donation program as a whole is extremely important because the funds from the sales of the boats go directly into the mission. It is phenomenal that people actually trust us enough to donate their vessels to us so we can sell them to put that revenue back into achieving the mission,\" she said.\nThe Charity Boat Auction will take place on Saturday ,Aug. 31. The doors open at 8 a.m. and the bidding starts at 11 a.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It's a four-letter word and certainly not ideal under any circumstances.Being debt-free is always better than being in debt. But not all debt is created equal. Generally, debt comes in two flavors: secured and unsecured.Secured debts are collateralized.That means the borrower pledges something of value to the lender that acts like a security deposit.If the borrower defaults, the lender gets ownership of that valuable asset. A home mortgage is probably the best example of reasonably safe, secured debt.In a mortgage, the property becomes the collateral.Unsecured debts, on the other hand, are wild and crazy because there is no security. Even worse, invariably, this kind of debt comes with double-digit interest rates. All it takes is the borrower's signature and the deed is done. This kind of debt is not safe, in fact it is toxic.Unsecured debt can ruin a life. Credit card debt is the best example of toxic debt. It looks so harmless.It offers so much convenience and flexibility. And nothing could be further from the truth. Unsecured consumer debt is like a steel trap armed with attractive bait to lure you in. Then, once you're in, it slams shut.I've been in the debt trap.It's a horrible place to be. It took me 13 years to gnaw my way out of a six-figure load of unsecured, toxic debt. My husband (a man of both of both long-suffering and integrity) and I didn't file for bankruptcy.We repaid every dime including interest, penalties and fees.I didn't get into the debt trap against my will. I did it to myself, naively and stupidly.I nibbled at that delicious bait. I chose to ignore the signs warning that I was heading for trouble if I didn't change my ways. I paid a terrible price for acting so foolishly.

He felt like there was a little unfinished business, and he knew he wanted to get back and have another chance at the same young man,\" Warrior boys head tennis coach Aaron Hutt said.\nHershey came within a win of becoming the first boys singles player to win a state title in school — and North Bayside — history a year ago, only to be denied by Poolesville's Andy Wu in the Class 2A final.\nCarrying an 18-0 record into this year's state tournament, Hershey was on course for a rematch with Wu. That second chance was foiled though, when Hereford's Harry Smith defeated Hershey, 7-5, 6-2 in the semifinals.\nWith his hopes for a rematch and a state title gone, the recently-graduated Hershey could have easily packed his bag and made the long, slow drive back from the Wilde Lake Tennis Club in Columbia to Easton in heavy Memorial Day weekend traffic. Instead, the senior fell back on the family, friends and teammates that watched him play May 23.\n\"I owe a lot of that to my family and the people I was there with; my teammates,\" Hershey said of moving forward. \"(Teammate) Clay Nagle, similar situation happened to him and his partner, Parker Jimenez (who lost in the mixed doubles semifinals). We went back (to the hotel), had a nice relaxing night. I think that's where the team aspect comes into it in moments like that, where they help you get yourself together when you might not be exactly where you want to be mentally.\"\nHershey returned the following day and defeated C. Milton Wright's Xavier Moaddel, 6-0, 6-4 in the third-place match, capping a 20-1 season in singles play that earned him the North Bayside's boys tennis player of the year as voted on by the division's coaches.\nNagle and Jimenez also rebounded from their semifinal loss, defeating Wilde Lake's Jakob Bluemner and Jillian Davis, 6-0, 6-0 in the third-place match in 2A mixed doubles.\n\"There's an old saying: You can let it go to your heart for a moment, but you can't let it go to your head,\" Hutt said of the disappointment that comes from a loss. \"And he was able to compartmentalize that loss, granted being very upset. But after a few hours, he put it together and said, 'OK, next challenge.' It's a testament not just to his resilience, but the experience he's gotten from traveling and playing some pretty high-level tennis.\"\nThat experience helped Hershey go undefeated during the regular season in singles, compile a 14-1 record in doubles, and win a third straight Class 2A East Region II singles title. And though he did not get a second crack at Wu — who went on to win a third straight 2A state title — Hershey showed growth through the season.\n\"I think he matured, and his ability to not be his own worst enemy was apparent,\" Hutt said of Hershey, who was 57-2 over four years in the regular season, and intends to continue playing at Catholic University. \"Last year, and past years, something might not go quite right and he internalized it automatically, forgetting that the other person has something to do with it as well. And that's kind of what greatness does. It looks at what it needs to do initially, and then it realizes, it's not just what I need to do, it's what I need to do to stop them as well. He got very good at that. Not only that, but being able to play every game as its own little match. He only lost a handful of games let alone sets.\"\nSt. Michaels' boys team didn't lose a match this season until the Bayside Conference championship, where it fell 4-3 to Stephen Decatur. But that was the lone blemish on a season of firsts for St. Michaels tennis, earning 11-year head coach Jordan Miller the North Bayside boys coach of the year.\n\"I knew we were going to be a very strong team,\" Miller said. \"I worked with throughout the year most of the players that we see. So I know what we have. And I also know what everybody else has. I knew our guys were putting in a lot of work. And that was going to be very helpful.\"\nOne year after falling shy of the division via a 4-3 loss against North Caroline, St. Michaels dominated its North competition with an 18-1 overall record, winning 14 matches by 7-0 scores, and three others by 6-1 margins. The Saints not only won their first division title and reached the conference championship for the first time, they earned a fourth consecutive 1A East Region I crown.\nSt. Michaels wasn't quite finished though.\nLexi Rockwell and Tom Weller teamed to win the school's first state tennis championship, when they won the 1A mixed doubles crown. That effort, coupled with Sean Kline and Miles Fox finishing third in boys doubles, and Tess Weller placing fourth in girls singles, helped the Saints take runner-up honors in the 1A team competition at states — another program first — by just one point.\n\"It was definitely a good feeling,\" Miller said.\nIt may also prove to be good motivation for next season.\n\"I talked with my assistant (Casey Capute),\" Miller said. \"We didn't like coming home with the second-place trophy as a team for states. And we didn't like coming home with a second-place (at Baysides). I hate for us to be, 'OK, we got a state championship and we're happy with that.'\n\"Prior to coming back (as head coach), I never knew what we were capable of,\" added Miller, a St. Michaels graduate. \"But the more I coached, the more I saw opportunities for us, if we could just get a few kids to really buy in. And now we've got quite a few more than a few kids that have bought in. And I think we're going to be able to hopefully maintain that for many years to come.\nHere's a look at the rest of the this year's teams\nFIRST TEAMSebastian Cousineau, So., Kent County\nBecame the first in school history to reach a state championship, where he lost in the 1A final to Boonsboro senior Hunter Liao, who became the state's first four-time state champion in boys singles. Cousineau was 13-2 in singles — his only other loss coming against Easton's Hershey — and 6-4 in doubles. The sophomore beat Colonel Richardson's Jeffrey Lin, 6-2, 6-4 to win 1A East I title.\nMiles Fox, Jr., St. Michaels\nFox was 14-2 in singles, which included a win against Decatur at Baysides. Teamed with Sean Kline in doubles, posting a 16-0 conference record, and a 21-1 overall mark. The tandem beat Decatur at Bayside, won the 1A East I boys doubles title with a 6-0, 6-0 sweep of Perryville's Holden Coe and Tyler Loss, and reached the state semifinals. Defeated Southern Garrett's Ben Nazelrod and Shane Sisler, 6-1, 6-2 in consolation final.\nSean Kline, So., St. Michaels\nKline posted a 13-3 singles mark during the regular season, losing only to Hershey, Cousineau and Queen Anne's County's Tyler Olah — all first-team all-North picks.\nLost singles match against Decatur at Baysides before he and Fox won the boys doubles title at regionals and took third at states.\nTyler Olah, Sr., Queen Anne's\nThe Lions' No. 1 went 14-5 in singles, 8-5 in doubles. He won the 2A East I singles championship with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over North East's Brady Dvorak. Lost in 2A state quarterfinals to Poolesville's Wu.\nSECOND TEAMTom Weller, Sr., St. Michaels; Clay Nagel, Sr., Easton; Christian Chase, Jr., North Dorchester; Bjorn Birkmire, So., Kent County; Will Taylor, Fr., Queen Anne's.\nHONORABLE MENTIONCambridge-SD: Jayden Mitchell, So.; Colonel Richardson: Jeffrey Lin, Jr.; Easton: Liam Edgell, Sr.; Lucas Myers, Jr.; Kent County: Teo O'Brien, Sr.; Robert Hague, Sr.; Kent Island: Dylan Bankard, Sr.; Carson Alplanalp, Sr.; North Caroline: Justin Hoover, So.; Jonnatan Luna, Jr.; Hayden Lukacsina, Sr.\nQueen Anne's: Ryan Breeding, Sr.; St. Michaels: Sebastian Cornish, Jr.; Willy Coale, So., Jeremiah Monroe, So. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It is an eye sore. I finally found an entrance and walked up and down the beach, surveying the project's progress.\nIt was a beautifully sunny Tuesday afternoon, and the Strand sat virtually empty other than a resident walking her dog and two girls tanning. The resident, who has lived in Oxford for decades, said the beach used to always be packed.\nThe fencing surrounding the beach and the living shoreline operate to support vegetation growth so the town doesn't have to replant every year.\nBut commissioners don't know how long the fencing will be up — could be a season, could be multiple.

    "content": "Budget discussions kicked off at Talbot Board of Ed work session\n\n December 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 619\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot Board of Education was presented with preliminary budget considerations during a Monday work session as planning for the fiscal year 2026 budget is underway.Talbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones outlined the priorities her team is focusing on. Those priorities include achieving academic equity in math, fostering an engaging environment for students and staff, and recruiting and retaining staff members.\nSuperintendent Sharon Pepukayi said those areas were determined as priorities during a board retreat last year.\n\"When the dust all ended, we said that these were the three priorities that we wanted to move forward with,\" Pepukayi said. \" … And then most recently, we've talked about special education being a focus for us as well.\"\nDuring the meeting, Jones provided an overview of the budget process and how the state's expansive 10-year education funding initiative, The Blueprint for Maryland's Future, allocates money on a per-student basis.\n\"Every student in our system grades (K-12) qualifies for a base amount, and that's called our foundation funding,\" Jones said. \"That's how we keep our lights on. That's how we have insurance.\"\nThen, depending on student classifications in other categories, such as multilingual learners and special education, more money is allocated to a school. Each school receives different funding based on their enrollment statistics, Jones said.\nShe added that the expectation from the state is that \"at least 75%\" of the money given toward a certain school is \"spent directly at that school.\" Costs related to human resources, finance and transportation often aren't school-specific.\nAccording to Jones, the district needs to \"make some shifts\" in two programs — compensatory education and multilingual learners — in order to comply with Blueprint requirements. No district in the state is fully compliant at this time, she noted, but the Blueprint Accountability & Implementation Board is seeking progress.\n\"We're just not spending enough money on those areas to meet criteria,\" Jones said.\nPepukayi said the strict requirements affect funding for smaller schools, a topic that's come up in her discussions with fellow superintendents on the Eastern Shore.\n\"The foundation funding is insufficient to do all that we need to do, particularly for the smaller schools, the districts that have smaller schools,\" she said. \" … It's compliance-driven and rigidness for our budgeting versus giving us the flexibility to make those decisions and differentiate ourselves.\"\nSchools and departments in the district submit budgets every year, along with providing a list of requested positions. Position requests include teachers, coaches, English second language professionals, special education staff and social workers.\n\"We're not at the level where we were at last year,\" Jones added.\nBoard President Emily Jackson brought up whether or not the district could revisit previous hopes to hire someone for a grants manager position since managing grants is a significant stress on the finance department.\nJones said it's \"burdensome\" to track all of the necessary results and data from grants.\n\"You have to have a really detailed knowledge of the public education landscape to be able to write those grants, I would say,\" Jones said. \"And that was our challenge.\"\nHowever, Jones was optimistic on the prospect that a grants manager could eventually help Talbot County Public Schools bring in more revenue.\n\"Hiring a grant person might make sense financially,\" she said. \"They might at least be able to pay for themselves, and then hopefully generate some revenue in other ways.\"\nThe Talbot County Board of Education will meet with the Talbot County Council on Jan. 7 to discuss a proposed budget. The proposed budget will first be brought to the board at a Jan. 13 work session, and then on Jan. 15 for first reader.\nAs of now, a public hearing on the budget is scheduled for Feb. 10, with a potential board vote slated for Feb. 12. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Voters will have the chance to decide state protections on abortion access and whether or not to codify it into the state constitution.During the 2023 General Assembly, state lawmakers passed an amendment that would enshrine the right to an abortion and \"reproductive freedom,\" in Maryland's constitution.\nThe United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June of 2022, with a 5-4 vote indicating there is no constitutional right to abortion. Since that summer, the topic of abortion has been a hot-button issue across the nation.\nStates have weighed establishing constitutional amendments declaring protection over the right to abortion, and constitutional amendments have been approved by voters in California, Vermont and Michigan.\nStates such as Tennessee, Alabama and West Virginia have passed amendments declaring that the state's constitution does not secure or protect a person's right to abortion.\nCurrently, abortion is legal in Maryland until viability and abortion is legal after viability if the woman's life or health is endangered or there is a fetal anomaly.\nWhat is on the ballot?Question 1, or the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment, would amend the Declaration of Rights in the Maryland Constitution to add a new section that guarantees a right to \"reproductive freedom.\" According to the referendum, the term \"reproductive freedom\" includes include \"the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue or end one's own pregnancy.\nIf the amendment is approved by voters, it would prohibit the constitutional right of abortion access from being denied or infringed unless there is a compelling state interest, which would need to be achieved using the least restrictive means.\nErin Bradley, board chair of Freedom in Reproductive Maryland, has been advocating for passing the referendum.\n\"What this legislation does is it protects (abortion) at the highest level possible,\" Bradley said during an event in August. \"It's very easy to change statutes in any state's constitutional amendments. As you see, I need all of you here to go vote for it. So we would need to do that every time we try to change the constitution. So this is the highest legal protection we can offer in the state of Maryland.\"\nThe referendum is endorsed by Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland State Education Association and Pro-Choice Maryland.\nOpponents of the referendum include the Maryland Catholic Conference, Maryland Right to Life PAC and Maryland Family Institute.\nFrank Arlinghause, a Maryland doctor opposing the referendum, described the then Maryland Senate bill as \"extreme.\"\n\"Amending the Maryland Constitution is an unusual and extreme measure, and this bill would take an extreme position on abortion, restricting the legislature's opportunities to pass reasonable restrictions on abortion in late pregnancy or to restrict it as other healthcare,\" Arlinghause said.\nUnderstanding Question 1:The amendment was introduced as Senate Bill 798 on Feb. 6, 2023 and was passed by the Maryland Senate with a 32-15 vote. On March 30 of that year, the Maryland House passed the bill by a 98-38 vote, with three absent or no voting.\nA yes vote supports adding a new article to the Maryland Constitution's Declaration of Rights establishing a right to reproductive freedom, defined to include \"the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end one's own pregnancy.\"\nA \"no\" vote opposes amending the state constitution to establish a right to reproductive freedom.\nEarly voting locations will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. until October 31. Election day is Tuesday November 5. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Using the archetype of the traveler, who is seen holding suitcases and voyaging through a wide array of landscapes towards a better place, Corona tackles the reality of the human aspect of climate change while celebrating the lushness and vibrancy of flora, bodies of water, and geographic forms, and bringing attention to the multitudinous powers of nature,\" according to AAM's summary of the exhibit.\"The artist transformed the Museum's Saul Atrium Gallery with site-specific vignettes that each picture a character journeying from a land made uninhabitable by global warming. The immersive, large-scale installation also features Corona's Climate Ponchos, which double as wearable sculptures: while their form recalls a simple rain poncho, the dynamic patterns on them tell stories of migration and history.\" AAM's 2022-2023 Atrium Commission is supported by Donna and Jim Alpi, Carol Gordean, Joseph and Alzbetka Robillard, and Mary Ann Schindler.The atrium exhibit programs started in 2021.Corona is a Baltimore-based artists whose work is and has been featured at the Baltimore Museum of Art, Kreeger Museum, Peale Museum, and the Walters Art Museum.Corona's AAM exhibit is entitled \"Terrestrial Caravan\".For more: https://academyartmuseum.org/hoesycorona/ \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The next couple of weeks will either confirm that Joe is the candidate, or another Democrat will rise to the occasion and take on Trump.While the top of the ticket is of immense importance, equally important are the priorities of the party. That is, no matter who the Democratic nominee is, there are certain principles and policies that are more likely to advance and be preserved if Democrats are elected.\nBelow is one person's Top 10 list of reasons why it is imperative to support the eventual Democratic nominee, whomever that may be, as well as Democratic candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives.\nThe Democrats will ...\nDeal with the climate challenges that are impacting our world by supporting clean energy and a phased reduction in fossil fuels.Recognize women's health care as a matter for a woman's conscience, her family, her doctor and her God, not nameless, faceless legislators.Be clear eyed about the existential threats that Russia, China, North Korea and Iran present to the free world.Continue to support our allies particularly Israel and Ukraine through our actions, not blustery promises.Know how important it is to appoint ethical justices to the Supreme Court that best reflect our nation's values so as to not allow further degradations to voting rights, health care options, gun control and climate protections.Continue economic policies that have pushed unemployment to historically low levels, jobs to new heights, spurred growth and managed an economy that continues to be the envy of the world.Be vigilant about future pandemics and rely on science and not conspiracy theories as how to best deal with them. Thousands of people died unnecessarily by a failure to have competent presidential leadership during COVID.Respect the results of elections.Not constantly lie to the American people.Not have four times indicted, twice impeached, convicted felon and serial liar running for commander in chief.\nThe choices are clear for November – support the Democratic nominee for president along with the Democratic ticket. It is too important to stay home.\nVote.\nDENNIS GLACKIN\nSt. Michaels \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Lessons learned from Donald Trump’s campaigns\n\n March 29, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 797\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n After every presidential election cycle, political pundits do a deep dive analysis on campaign strategies that were effective before the campaign launch and during the campaign.One of the most insightful and thought provoking analyses I have seen was written by Michael Grynbaum and John Koblin, published in the New York Times the day after the election.\nIn their article — \"Master of the Media Evolved Yet Again\" — Grynbaum and Koblin wrote, \"In his improbable journey to the apex of American power, President-elect Donald J. Trump has always adapted to the media tool of the moment.\"\nFormer president of CBS News, Andrew Heyward, echoes that conclusion: \"He's always looking to the next venue that's best suited to his instincts for generating support. It's part of Trump's extraordinary record of instinctively finding ways to viscerally connect with voters. He's a master of evolving media.\"\nThese observations are not a surprise based on reviewing Trump's career before his running for the presidency three times.\nWell before he ran for president the first time in 2016, Trump generated substantial name recognition in New York City and beyond with regular coverage in the New York Post. The Post, a daily tabloid newspaper, has the fourth-largest circulation of a printed newspaper in America. Its readership goes well beyond New York with a subscription-based online version.\nIn 2004, Trump recognized and seized an opportunity for even greater public exposure as the co producer and host of the reality TV show \"The Apprentice.\"\nDuring a long run on NBC TV, Trump worked hard to be viewed as a successful and decisive business mogul, willing to dismiss apprentice contestants with a memorable \"you're fired.\"\nThe result of that name recognition together with his \"take charge\" personality, was a key element in Trump defeating a large field of candidates in the 2016 Republican presidential primary elections. That led to a widely unexpected Electoral College win in November 2024.\nGrynbaum and Koblin wrote, \"Trump recognized the power of Twitter long before other politicians, and in 2016, he started doing cable news interviews.\"\nThey also wrote that he bypassed traditional media gatekeepers like \"60 Minutes\" on CBS, in favor of select online celebrities and podcasts that were especially popular among young men.\nAs an example, Grynbaum and Koblin noted that \"Bryson DeChambeau, a two-time U.S. Open golfing champion and YouTube star, did a video with Trump that had almost 13 million views.\"\nMore important than the always critical role of positive name recognition in any election, Grynbaum and Koblin suggested that bypassing the mainstream media allowed Trump to avoid confrontational interviews where he might have faced tough questions, fact-checks and detailed policy debates.\nBy contrast, Grynbaum and Koblin suggested the carefully selected influencers Trump met rarely challenged him and often lavished him with praise.\nThe political wisdom of that strategy was affirmed in the one debate hosted by ABC news. Donald Trump did not do as well as expected, and Kamala Harris did better than expected.\nFollowing that debate, Trump declined to participate in a second debate and also pulled out of a planned interview with 60 Minutes. His decision not to appear was the first time since the late 1960s, when the program did not include host the two major-party presidential candidates.\nTrump's ignoring 60 Minutes was one of many based on his lack of trust in and disdain for many traditional legacy media outlets that he believed were left of center and hostile to him.\nDespite the risk of a negative voter reaction to his positions on the traditional media outlets, Trump assumed correctly that it would energize and mobilize his base if he regularly ignored and aggressively criticized the media, especially the legacy media.\nEven before that decision on 60 Minutes was made, Trump was showing up on podcasts, widely viewed as unconventional and even odd in the context of a presidential campaign.\nHis first podcast with online star and wrestler Logan Paul met that profile. Trump and Paul discussed boxing, immigration and the possible existence of extraterrestrial life.\nSome may say this commentary is all about Trump. I agree. The reasons are simple.\nDonald Trump has been elected president twice. This commentary includes my thoughts and thoughts of others on how the role of effective communication strategies contributed to those outcomes.\nKamala Harris has not yet been elected president and maybe never will be. In any event, I expect to do another commentary that will include my thoughts and the thoughts of others on how flawed communication strategies contributed to her loss in 2024.\nFor now, campaign communications strategies covered in this commentary, may or may not be relevant in upcoming elections in 2026, 2028 and beyond.\nThat said, I suggest there is one timeless lesson for all political candidates going forward. That lesson is: never fail to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of and use best practice in campaign communications strategies, especially those that are emerging. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Game-time decision': Clouds, storms could dim eclipse viewing in some parts of U.S.\n\n April 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: National \n \n 633\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Cloudy skies and stormy weather could dampen viewing of Monday's total solar eclipse in some parts of the U.S.That includes regions of the country that are part of the April 8 eclipse's path of totality where the moon will completely darken the sun for as much as four minutes.\nThe totality path stretches from Texas and Arkansas through parts of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio and into upstate New York and New England.\nMore than 4 million people are expected to travel for the eclipse — which is the largest such event in the U.S. since 1806.\nMonday's eclipse will be visible to varying degrees across the U.S.\nBut some areas in the path of totality and other parts of the country may have their eclipse viewing dimmed by cloudy, overcast and stormy skies during the moon's two-hour journey across the sun.\n\"Unfortunately, the weather isn't panning out. It won't be favorable in some of these areas,\" said Brandon Buckingham, a meteorologist for AccuWeather.\nBuckingham said parts of Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas — which are attracting scores of eclipse viewers because of their propensity for clearer skies — might see clouds and storms during the eclipse.\nAreas of northern Ohio in the eclipse path are also expecting surges of visitors. They could also see some cloudy conditions.\n\"It's kind of a blend of clouds and sun,\" said Buckingham of the Monday forecast for northern Ohio.\nStill, the eclipse could be visible through cloudy conditions depending on the types of clouds as well as their prevalence and depth.\nThe weather dynamics would send eclipse tourists and the scores of astronomers and researchers driving to destinations with clearer skies. That could add to the already expected traffic congestion dynamics expected on Monday.\nBuckingham, who is based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, plans on driving to view the eclipse. He's still figuring out the best place to view the solar eclipse in its totality.\n\"It's one of those game-time decisions,\" he said.\nBEST PLACES TO VIEW\nMarc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the eclipse forecast is still developing. There's a cold front moving eastward across the U.S. and storms and clouds being fostered in the Gulf of Mexico that will head west.\n\"Right now, it's still a bit uncertain,\" Chenard said, of where, when and how many clouds might be in the skies during the afternoon eclipse.\nHe said the most clear areas to view the eclipse in the totality path could be in northern parts of Arkansas, southeastern Missouri, southern Illinois and southern Indiana.\nHe said parts of New England and Canada could also be clear, but the eclipse viewing in places such as Ohio could depend on the amount and depth of cloud cover.\nMid-Atlantic areas could see a mix bag for viewing with partly cloudy conditions forecasted for Easton, Ocean City and other parts of the Eastern Shore for Monday — the day of the eclipse.\nChenard said areas in Texas could also be \"a game-time decision\" in terms of eclipse visibility with clear skies expected in western areas of the state and more cloudy weather and storms to the east.\n\"It really could go either way,\" said Chenard, who will be visiting Texas for the eclipse.\nIn other parts of the U.S, the moon will partially block out the sun Monday afternoon.\nBuckingham said Southern California as well as central parts of the state and the Southwest could have good viewing weather while parts of the Mountain West (including Montana and Wyoming) and upper Midwest could see overcast conditions.\nGulf coast areas of Louisiana and Mississippi could see rain and clouds while the big cities of east coast such as New York, Boston and Washington D.C. could see some clouds generally decent eclipse viewing weather\nChenard said the Central Plains, Texas and Oklahoma panhandles along with Georgia and Florida can expect clear skies for the celestial event.\n\"The Southeast looks pretty good,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I want the kids to walk in feeling confident, walking in with a sense of belonging, that they can use their voice to ask for what they need instead of being afraid,\" she said.\nAmy Dodson, the Talbot County Board of Education School Board member for District 3, dropped off her three kids at Easton Elementary Monday morning.\n\"As a mom you are always a little anxious the first day, but they are in great hands,\" she said. \"The took off.

    "content": "ON THE REBOUND\n\n September 3, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 834\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — If.That's how Matt Griffith started his preseason commentary entering his 10th year as Easton High's head football coach.\nGriffith's first word is certainly understandable considering starting quarterback Mikey O'Connor suffered a season-ending injury in Week 2 of last year, which played a huge role in the Warriors going 1-8.\n\"If we can healthy, 'cause we got low numbers, and continue to improve we should be able to put a good product out on the field,\" said Griffith, who also lost his starting quarterback, Mason Ledford, in Week 2 of the 2017 season.\nA 6-foot-3, 195-pound senior, the left-handed throwing O'Connor returns as the starter behind center, and is backed by 6-3, 220-pound sophomore Brady Walls, a transfer from St. Mary's.\n\"Mikey looks really good,\" said Griffith, of the third O'Connor brother to start at quarterback for the Warriors. \"The transfer kid (Walls) is pretty good, too.\"\nEaston's backfield not only looks pretty good, but appears plenty deep. Junior Dustin Blue (5-11, 212) and sophomore Jordan Horsey form a nice, physical one-two punch. Freshman Jamier Copper (5-9, 195), juniors JaSere Molina (5-7, 160) and Tayshaun Roberts (5-8, 180), and senior Najhay Smith (5-9, 175) are also expected to get rotated into the ground game.\n\"Really deep at running back,\" Griffith said. \"We've got five kids that I think we can hand the ball off to and we're not missing much of anything. The first two are bruisers with Dustin and Jordan. They're a load to tackle. And JaSere gives us a nice change of pace with a different type speed. He's pretty quick.\"\nQuickness is also found in a receiving corps that welcomes the return of senior standout Chase Raab (5-11, 180), who never got on the field a year ago after an injury in 7-on-7 summer play wiped out his entire season.\n\"That's a big, big lift for us, getting him back,\" Griffith said of Raab. \"And he's 100 percent, which is good.\"\nThe rest of the receiving cast doesn't look too shabby either, with junior wideouts Carter Mooney (5-11, 180) and Logan Friend (5-10, 160), and seniors Jaden Prestwood (6-3, 215) and Finn Gunshenan (5-10, 170). The Warriors' biggest threats though may be at slot. Senior Colin Mooney (5-7, 170) returns and is joined by juniors Diontaye Copper (5-10, 185), Kyree Acree (5-11, 175) and Zach Barnhart (5-8, 180).\n\"We have a good core that we can cycle through and get breaks on offense, and not have any drop-offs because some of these guys are going to be playing on the defensive side of the ball as well,\" Griffith said. \"It's going to be nice to be able to go, 'Kyree you're going in for Diontaye, and Zach,' and vice versa to be able to get them some breaks.\"\nEaston lost four starters from the offensive line, with junior right tackle Tymiere Thomas (5-10, 240) the lone returner. But Griffith has liked his young group's development and praised the work of assistants Drew Griffith — his son — and Dave Perillo, the longtime line coach at Queen Anne's County.\nJunior Trushun Truxon Jr. (5-11, 190) starts at center, with freshman guard Brady Gilliece (6-3, 225) and sophomore tackle Xavier Stowers (6-3, 230) lining up on his left, and junior guard Jack Chapple (6-4, 220) joining Thomas on the right side. Senior Nathaniel Lapp (6-7, 225) and juniors Paul Whitlock (5-10, 210) and Tracey Gore (6-0, 285) could also be moved in and out of the lineup.\n\"Young. Inexperienced. But a very good work in progress,\" Griffith said of his offensive front. \"They're improving every day. It's good sized and most of those kids spent time in the weight room.\"\nThe defense has many of the same faces, with a few different ones sprinkled through.\nSophomore Elias Leonard (5-10, 305) is at nose guard, where Groce and Truxon could also get time. Thomas is back at one tackle and has looked great in the preseason, according to his head coach. Teaming with him up front will be a rotation of Stowers, Lapp, Gilliece, Whitlock and Chapple.\nInside linebacker should be a strength, with Blue and Horsey starting, and Copper, Gunshenan and junior Alex Rhodes (5-10, 180) in reserve. Prestwood and Roberts start outside, but Griffith noted sophomores Nevin Whitaker (5-9, 190) and Teddy Antal (6-0, 175) could see time.\nThe secondary is athletic and fast, with Acree, Copper, Friend, Molina and Carter Mooney at the corners. Raab starts at free safety, while Colin Mooney and Barnhart are at strong safety.\n\"They're learning the new system under coach (Al) Waters,\" Griffith said of his new defensive coordinator, who has coached at Queen Anne's and Cambridge-South Dorchester. \"They're enjoying it. It's not a lot different from what we're used to. We're starting to do less thinking and play a little faster.\"\nSenior Dominic Stanco, who also plays soccer, handles the place-kicking chores. Horsey and Walls will punt.\n\"Very excited to see how they continue to improve,\" Griffith said of his team.\nEaston opens Friday when its hosts North East of Cecil County, coached by Warrior alum Taylor Slaughenhoupt. Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Eagles' offensive coordinator Moore becomes New Orleans head coach\n\n February 11, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 667\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n NEW ORLEANS — Kellen Moore, who oversaw the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles ' offense this season, has agreed to return to the site of his latest triumph as the next coach of the New Orleans Saints.The 36-year-old Moore will join an organization that has been floundering since the retirement of quarterback Drew Brees and departure of Super Bowl-winning coach Sean Payton. The Saints haven't made the playoffs since the 2020 season — the last of Brees' career.\nTheir interest in Moore became increasingly evident as the club waited longer to fill its vacancy than any other NFL team seeking a new coach this year.\nMoore was the only assistant coach on either Super Bowl team to be interviewed by New Orleans and thus the only candidate who, under league rules, could not be hired until after Sunday's title game was played. The Saints announced their agreement with Moore on Tuesday.\nTheir decision mirrors that of several teams that have found success after hiring relatively young offensive coaches. They included the Los Angeles Rams with Sean McVay, Green Bay with Matt LaFleur, Miami with Mike McDaniel and Minnesota with 2024 AP Coach of the Year Kevin O'Connell. All four of those coaches were hired while in their 30s.\nA standout college quarterback at Boise State, Moore had a six-year career as a practice squad or reserve QB with Detroit (2012-2014) and Dallas (2015-2017). He played in just three regular-season games, all with the Cowboys in 2015.\nHe moved into coaching in 2018 as a quarterbacks coach and was promoted to offensive coordinator in 2019. He left Dallas to join the Los Angeles Chargers in 2023 before moving to Philadelphia in 2024.\nWhile Moore tended to favor pass-heavy schemes in his early years as a coordinator, he adapted when he joined the Eagles.\nRecognizing Philadelphia's strength as a running team — with its big, physical offensive line, star running back Saquon Barkley and mobile quarterback Jalen Hurts — Moore oversaw the NFL's second-ranked ground game in 2024.\nThe Eagles rushed for a franchise-record 3,048 yards, with Barkley gaining 2,005 of that before adding an additional 499 yards in four playoff games. And when the Chiefs limited Barkley to 57 yards rushing in the Super Bowl, Moore responded with well-timed passing plays that included touchdowns of 46 yards to DeVonta Smith and 12 yards to A.J. Brown.\nMoore takes over an offense featuring versatile running back Alvin Kamara and receiver Chris Olave.\nWhile in New Orleans for the Super Bowl this past week, Moore discussed how he tries feature the strengths of available personnel in his play-calling.\n\"You have certain things that you have strong feelings about from a coaching perspective — certain philosophies — but I think it's important to do what your players do best,\" Moore said. \"Going from Dallas to LA to Philadelphia, we've certainly played three different styles, and it's fun when you team up with people just building it however we want to.\"\nSaints quarterback Derek Carr has two years left on his contract, but his future with the Saints is cloudy following a pair of non-playoff seasons with the club.\nMoore will become the Saints' second head coach since Payton briefly retired following the 2021 season, during which New Orleans went 9-7 and narrowly missed the playoffs.\nThat was the first of what is now four straight seasons without a playoff berth.\nPayton's former defensive coordinator, Dennis Allen, took over in 2021, only to go 18-25 during 2 1/2 seasons before being fired following a seven-game skid.\nDarren Rizzi, who was a special teams coordinator under both Payton and Allen, took over on an interim basis and went 3-5.\nHe wanted to remain with the Saints and interviewed for the full-time job after this season. New Orleans also interviewed Miami Dolphins coordinator Anthony Weaver, New York Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka, Detroit defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn and Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Brady.\nFormer Dallas and Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy also was expected to interview with New Orleans but withdrew his candidacy on Jan. 28, just days after Brady withdrew. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

But there are moments when silence becomes complicity. This election was one of those moments.\nIn the race for Easton Town Council president, Don Abbatiello's victory is a rebuke of disturbing tactics. What should have been a thoughtful campaign about Easton's future devolved into a smear operation.\nResidents's mailboxes were flooded with campaign mailers riddled with distortions, personal attacks and fabricated attributions.\nThis wasn't a fluke. It's part of a broader pattern, including in the last mayoral race and in Talbot's last Board of Education election, where similar mis- and disinformation tactics were deployed.\nLet's be clear: This is not how we build trust in our institutions or inspire faith in local government.\nWe must recognize what this climate costs us. Running for office is hard. It takes courage, vulnerability and a willingness to serve.\nWhen elections are defined by deceit and personal destruction, we risk deterring good people from stepping forward. Toxic tactics don't just harm their intended targets — they corrode our civic culture and discourage participation at every level. Do we want to be a community where fewer of our neighbors are willing to put their name on the ballot?\nThat's why Don Abbatiello's candidacy — and his win — matter so deeply. He chose a different path. He ran a campaign grounded in service, not slander. He listened, engaged and refused to stoop to the politics of fear. His leadership style reflects the best of Easton: respectful, thoughtful, inclusive and committed to all residents — not just those aligned with one political view.\nIn electing Don, the people of Easton showed that they value honesty over artifice and unity over division. They showed that even when misinformation floods, truth still has the power to rise above it.\nLet's take heart in this result and the historic turnout for this election. It shows that voters are paying attention. It reminds us that integrity still wins. And it proves that voting matters.\nPHIL JACKSON\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

MICHAELS — St. Michaels commissioners dove into the process of renewing the town's comprehensive plan with a workshop meeting on Tuesday.One of the main topics discussed was the town's priorities for the updated plan, which is revised every 10 years.\nWhile no firm decisions were made, the commissioners said existing passages in the current plan would be taken into consideration.\nCommissioners President Jay Hudson said there will be a special meeting schedule to discuss the commissioners priorities.\n\"We have been discussing getting together with a special session to discuss what those priorities are,\" Hudson said. \"As you know, we've just hired a new town manager as of April, and he's been busy getting himself acclimated to his role. Now it is time for us to sit down and kind of prioritize projects moving forward.\"\nHudson said that the commissioners would come back to the Nov. 5 comprehensive plan meeting with priorities mapped out. Hudson also mentioned that the priorities in already outlined in Chapter 14 of the comprehensive plan will be the road map.\nDuring the meeting, commissioners brought up multiple concerns and items they wished were included within the plan. Commissioner Alexis Roiter mentioned demographics as a consideration. Hudson said that the Planning Commission plans to add all of those to the plan before the next meeting.\n\"Those are easy ones. Looking at a 10 year plan, it's definitely necessary to see what the demographics are when we're writing it,\" Hudson said.\nWith federal funding in question, to make sure all of St. Michaels plan can be completed, the town plans to strengthen its relationship with Talbot County.\n\"I think all the municipalities in Talbot County have a wonderful working relationship with the county,\" Hudson said. \"I think now with grant funding running out and having a better idea of what we need moving forward, I think for us now it's imperative to strengthening the relationships with the county. It's more creating these programs so that these relationships can work.\"\nThe special meeting to discuss the commissioners' priorities for the comprehensive plan has not been scheduled yet, but the next comprehensive plan meeting will be Nov. 5 at 5 p.m. at 407 St. Mary's Square. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This campaign unfairly targets our schools, students, and dedicated Talbot County Public Schools educators.\nOur team does face challenges like many school districts, and we face them directly and with transparency. While we do not want to give life to these messages you are receiving, we want to make sure our community knows the truth.\nWe are working to improve our performance on state assessments. With support from the Talbot County Council, we have made significant investments, including acquiring new rigorous standards-based curricula and hiring and retaining qualified teachers and administrators. Additionally, we have made math one of our priorities and are putting concentrated efforts into the teaching and learning of this curricular area. We also know that student success is measured by many indicators in addition to state assessment scores.\nWhile we know we have work to do, there is growth we can celebrate. The 23-24 Maryland Comprehensive Assessment results showed modest improvement across all Maryland districts. In Talbot County, our overall margin of progress was slightly greater than what the state achieved. In English/Language Arts, out of the 24 school districts, Talbot County Public Schools had the greatest increase in students being proficient. These results inform our continued work on the initiatives put in place to provide our educators with the resources needed to ensure student success.\nWe adhere to the Health Education Standards set forth by the Maryland Department of Education. Maryland state law requires that parents/guardians be notified about topics covered in the Family Life unit. They have the option of having their student excused if they are uncomfortable with this content being taught to their students by TCPS educators.\nOur Talbot County students graduate from our high schools and continue to excel in college, career and life. This is a result of their hard work, the commitment of the TCPS team, the leadership of the Board of Education and the support of the County Council and our many community partners.\nOur support staff, teachers and administrators are dedicated professionals who deserve our trust and support. By collaborating openly and constructively, we can ensure that our school system remains a beacon of opportunity and excellence for every child, regardless of their background.\nWe invite the community to our established public forums scheduled each month through our regular Board of Education meetings. These meetings are open to all citizens, and we encourage everyone to attend and participate in these sessions. Only through collaboration and communication do we truly provide the best opportunities for our students.\nWe are honored to serve as Talbot County's superintendent of schools and president of the Board of Education, and we are very proud of our students and staff. We believe in and will continue to advocate for TCPS students, families and educators. We are TCPS, and we are committed to transforming and performing together.\nIf you have questions or concerns, please email us at info@talbotschools.org. We are here for you and all of the children of Talbot County. Thank you for your continued support.\nSharon Pepukayi is the superintendent of Talbot County Public Schools. Emily Jackson is president of the Talbot County Board of Education. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Easton council rejects Gunsallus' proposal to delay introduction of campaign finance law\n\n April 22, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 784\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Town Council members held a heated discussion Monday on a proposed ordinance mandating campaign finance reporting in town elections.Before the opening Pledge of Allegiance and prayer, council President Frank Gunsallus moved to remove the campaign finance law's introduction from Monday's meeting agenda.\nGunsallus said the law shouldn't be introduced due to current conflicts of interest existing with the town's upcoming election.\nMayor Megan Cook and Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery announced their sponsorship of the ordinance last week. It comes as the town's May 6 election nears, with Gunsallus facing off against current Ward 2 representative Don Abbatiello in an increasingly heated race. Montgomery, along with Ward 1's Maureen Curry, have publicly endorsed Abbatiello.\nOn Monday, Gunsallus read a letter he sent to the Attorney General's Office, requesting guidance for how to proceed with the ordinance that he called \"retroactive.\"\nMontgomery and town attorney Sharon VanEmburgh, who drafted the ordinance, said the ordinance would not retroactively apply to the May 6 election.\n\"This won't apply to this election,\" VanEmburgh said. \"If you're thinking about a conflict, there will always be a conflict for all five of you because you will all at some point potentially be running for reelection. This is for a future election.\"\nGunsallus said he didn't feel comfortable discussing the ordinance without clarification from the attorney general. VanEmburgh said the attorney general has no authority over the town election, later adding it's unlikely the attorney general will offer an official opinion to Gunsallus' request.\nWhen Gunsallus said he would not entertain the ordinance as an agenda item, Montgomery moved to overrule him and was joined by the remaining three council members.\n\"All we're saying is that we want to move forward with (the ordinance) at a first reading,\" Curry said.\nTHE ORDINANCE\nAs drafted, the ordinance would require candidates to have a treasurer file campaign contribution reports to the town before and after the election. It would also set a maximum $250 contribution limit for all individuals, businesses and organizations, excluding the candidate and their spouse or partner.\nCouncilmembers shared mixed thoughts.\nWard 4 Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis said it's a \"good starting point\" but emphasized it needs to use \"inclusive language.\"\nCurry said, \"not everyone has a spouse\" and asked if the limits would apply to other family members. VanEmburgh said as written, other family members would need to adhere to the $250 cap.\nCouncil members agreed to further discuss the ordinance at a workshop May 19. Residents, though, were more steadfast in their concerns during a heated public comment session.\nResident Daniel McBride said the $250 limit \"seems a bit arbitrary\" and \"serves as a barrier to free expression of town voters.\" McBride and other residents said it would put grassroots or less wealthy candidates at a disadvantage.\nResidents also questioned Montgomery and Cook for introducing the ordinance so soon before next month's election, with some labeling it election interference and an attack on Gunsallus' campaign.\n\"I believe it was done to try to destroy one of the members of the council,\" Catherine Nobles said.\nCAMPAIGN DONATIONS\nAt the onset of Monday's meeting, Gunsallus asked the council to \"follow my lead by disclosing your campaign finances ... with the state.\" He has been reporting online through the Maryland Campaign Reporting Information System each January since he was elected.\nIn the system, the most recent filing from the Friends of Frank Gunsallus shows campaign finances from Jan. 11, 2024 through Jan. 8, 2025.\nMontgomery encouraged Gunsallus to report finances from his ongoing campaign.\n\"I do not understand how you can claim that you have revealed your campaign expenditures in the state when there's nothing there,\" Montgomery said.\nGunsallus said Monday that transparency is \"paramount\" and he will continue reporting through the state next January. Tuesday, Gunsallus told The Star Democrat that he's received approximately $16,000 in campaign contributions from 34 donors.\nAbbatiello sent a log of campaign donations to the town office Monday.\nFrom Dec. 29, 2024, through Monday, Abbatiello has brought in just over $13,000. More than 70 individual donors are listed, though Abbatiello said he's not releasing their specific donation amounts since \"many people donated believing their names and donations would not end up on a list or scrutinized by the public.\"\n\"I also think that what's more important than the dollar amount, is that with only a few exceptions, the donors live in Easton,\" Abbatiello wrote in an email to The Star Democrat. \"I'm also not taking any money from a political party or any group with a special interest in town.\"\nIn an interview with The Star Democrat's editorial board Tuesday, Gunsallus said the proposed campaign finance ordinance is \"nonsensical\" and that the town could instead fall in line with state law regarding campaign finance disclosures.\n\"We don't have to have political theater as we witnessed last night,\" Gunsallus said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Our nonprofit organization's mission is to ensure that every child has the right to thrive in a safe and permanent home.CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) volunteers play a vital role in this mission. As caring and involved adults, they work to identify the unique needs of each child, advocate in court for essential services, and collaborate with agency partners to facilitate timely and safe resolutions.\nMost importantly, CASA volunteers become trusted figures in the lives of the children they serve, often providing stability, support and consistency.\nThis commitment is especially significant during the holiday season. For many children, this time of year is about creating joyful memories with family. However, for those placed in foster care, the holidays can be a stark reminder of their circumstances and what they are missing. CASA volunteers offer vital support, helping these children find hope amidst the challenges.\n\"Speaking up for children is our guiding principle,\" said Robin Davenport, CASA's executive director. \"It reinforces our belief that a brighter future is possible for every child we serve... As we approach the holiday season, we are profoundly grateful for our extraordinary CASA volunteers. Their unwavering dedication to vulnerable children is a true treasure in our community.\"\nNational studies confirm the value of CASA — findings show that children are more hopeful when a CASA is in their lives.\nCASA volunteers come from all walks of life, have varied experiences and professions, and are at least 21 years of age. After completing the application and screening process, individuals participate in pre-service training before being sworn in as officers of the court. CASA welcomes volunteers from all cultures, races, ethnicities and backgrounds.\nTo learn more about becoming a volunteer, visit casamidshore.org or email jc@casamidshore.org. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Last week, Talbot County Council members introduced the same resolution to appear on the 2024 general election ballot.During a May 28 meeting, the council unanimously introduced a resolution to place a question on the ballot at the 2024 general election to amend section 614 of the charter of Talbot County to allow the council to add up to one cent per $100 of assessed value above the revenue cap for an additional five years beginning July 1, 2026.\nAccording to the resolution document, the original resolution was adopted by a 5-0 vote of the Talbot County Council on July 21, 2020. The resolution was approved by the majority of Talbot County voters at the 2020 general election.\nThis resolution would \"allow but not require\" the Talbot County Council to add up to one cent per one hundred dollars of assessed value above the revenue cap for an additional five years.\nTalbot County Attorney Patrick Thomas said that as of July 1, 2021, revenues derived from property taxes included in the constant yield tax rate certification shall not increase more than 2% from the previous year.\nThis increase has helped offset the county's costs of maintaining public safety, officials said.\nClay Stamp, the county manager of Talbot County, said he was a public supporter of the resolution when it was initially introduced because it would assist in providing quicker services for the residents of Talbot County.\nOver the last fiscal year, the one-cent initiative has provided about $200,000 for the county to offset the public safety budget, which includes law enforcement, fire departments and other emergency services.\nWhen reintroduced in May, Council Member Dave Stepp said over half of Talbot County voters supported this resolution in 2020. The funds generated from this resolution have solved many problems Stepp has seen in neighboring counties, he said.\n\"It would benefit our public services here in Talbot County,\" Stepp said. \"The names of the departments that would make it to the ballot question would be the Sheriff's department, Department of Emergency Services as well as the Department of Corrections. We've seen a lot of positive things that have happened in those departments over the years.\"\nStepp asked his fellow council members to support the resolution and allow residents to decide whether or not they would like to see it implemented for the following five years.\nThe council unanimously voted to introduce the resolution. A public hearing will be on Tuesday, June 25. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "'It's iconic': Tunis Mills residents push back against county design for bridge replacement\n\n August 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 692\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TUNIS MILLS — More than 50 people gathered at St Stephens AME Church Wednesday evening to engage with county leaders regarding proposed construction to replace the Leeds Creek Bridge in Tunis Mills.County employees and project engineers presented plans to replace the 345-foot wooden bridge. Designs propose a structure with a \"laminated timber deck\" and \"asphalt wearing surface.\"\nResidents living in and around Tunis Mills expressed a bevy of concerns about county designs Wednesday evening. Many testified to the bridge's uniqueness and fit in the community, while others are worried an asphalt surface would jeopardize the safety for residents, particularly children and teenagers.\n\"People love this bridge, it's iconic,\" Doug Marvin, who lives near the bridge, said. \"I didn't grow up here, and I heard about it years before I bought the house where I did. It's like tradition for every kid that goes to school in this county to jump off the bridge … It's used in photographs, for tourism, to get people to come to this county.\"\nPrompted by a question from the audience, nearly every single attendee raised a hand when posed with the choice of a timber surface versus an asphalt one.\nAt the end of the meeting, County Manager Clay Stamp said that the county and its public works department \"will go back to the drawing board to a degree\" to explore the wooden surface option.\n\"At this point I think it's fair to assure you that moving in the direction of a wooden deck bridge is the direction we are seeking,\" Stamp said.\nPROJECT DESIGNSThe meeting began with a presentation of the proposed designs, which the county has said is around 90 to 95% complete.\nProposed changes to the bridge include adding an additional two feet of clearance, replacing timber piles with steel piles, adding a wooden laminated deck that can be paved over, widening the bridge slightly for walkers and improving a ramp and unloading platform. Several other bridges in the county have undergone similar laminated deck replacements.\nThe Talbot County Council first discussed replacing the bridge in 2007, allocating $1.8 million to the replacement project. Now, the project's estimated cost is around $6 million, with around $4.5 million federally funded.\nMark Ledebur, an engineering consultant, noted drawbacks to a full timber structure at Wednesday's meeting.\nHe said county experiences show an asphalt surface is less labor-intensive, easier to plow, smoother and easier to replace. Ledebur also presented quotes obtained by the county for timber boards in the case of replacement.\nOne resident asked if the county could compare costs for timber boards and asphalt, along with how often each material may have to be replaced. County Engineer Ray Clarke said his department could work on those comparisons.\nA project schedule shown to attendees on Wednesday projected a final decision for the bridge replacement this September, though Clarke emphasized the county is not ready to submit and is keeping the option of a wooden surface open.\nRESIDENT INPUTSusan McDermott leads a citizen group vowing for the bridge on Tunis Mills Road to remain as a full wooden structure.\nThe group, which has met with the county in the past, asserts that a timber structure is more durable than other materials and has environmental benefits. During the meeting, McDermott emphasized that the Leeds Creek Bridge is unique compared to busier bridges in Talbot County.\n\"Don't put an asphalt smear in the middle of our community,\" McDermott said. \"We don't want it, and we don't need it.\"\nMany residents that spoke Wednesday said an asphalt surface would only encourage speeding across the bridge. Both the current posted speed limit and the proposed one are 15 mph.\nSome were worried for the safety of children and teenagers who jump off the bridge into the creek as an unofficial tradition in the area. Resident Claudia Donegan said kids \"interact with this bridge intimately.\"\nPeter Stifel lives right across from the bridge and has driven over it for almost 60 years. On Wednesday, Stifel said his support for a wooden replacement is a \"vote for tradition.\"\n\"It is the heart and soul of a village,\" Stifel said of the bridge. \"And I'd hate to see it succumb to the plastic, push-button world that we are all being forced into.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Foxworth won't allow it. His son is playing flag football instead.\nWhen might he allow his son to play tackle? Foxworth said, \"We'll see.\"\n\"It's definitely not going to be before high school,\" said Foxworth, a former NFL cornerback and former president of the NFL Players Association. \"I guess that would be the first time that we even consider the conversation. Right now he's in the fifth grade, so we've got some time for him to fall in love with something else.\"\nInterviews with several former NFL players, some of whom played tackle football before high school, revealed a range of opinions about whether children should participate in tackle leagues.\nSome are categorically opposed to youth playing tackle before age 12 or 14. Others said they would consider what a child wanted. All interviewed for this article said their thoughts about the sport had evolved since their days as youth players.\n\"I honestly don't see the benefit of playing tackle football at a young age because flag football now is so available,\" said Muhammad Oliver, a former defensive back who played four years in the NFL.\nOliver said if taught correctly the skills learned in flag football can translate to tackle football. He said flag football allows kids to pick up the fundamentals of the sport and understand how it's played.\nOliver has seven children, four of whom are boys ages 27, 23, 12 and 9. His oldest son, Isaiah, plays for the San Francisco 49ers. Oliver allowed Isaiah to begin playing in a tackle league at age 8. If he had it to do over again, he said, Isaiah wouldn't have played tackle football until he was 12.\nOliver said his experience as a youth tackle football coach and as president of NX Level AthletX, a youth multisport development program in Goodyear, Arizona, has influenced his thinking. So has recent medical research linking youth tackle football to later-life challenges, such as impulse control and cognitive decline.\n\"With all the information now about concussions and how often concussions are happening and the number of concussions that players have had over their lifetime, I just don't feel like the contact is necessary young,\" Oliver said.\nFormer Super Bowl champion and Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson has been outspoken in warning of the risks of brain injury from the sport.\nIn 2018, Carson was one of the ex-players to appear at a news conference sponsored by the Concussion Legacy Foundation announcing a campaign to discourage tackle football before the age of 14. Carson has repeatedly said in interviews that if he had it to do again, he would not have played football.\nNeither of Carson's two sons played football at a competitive level, he said. Carson, who played 13 seasons for the New York Giants, has discouraged his grandson from playing.\nCarson advocates for transparency and education. \"I would like for the surgeon general to issue a warning to parents,\" he said, adding that adults should understand the risks of the sport.\n\"Every parent should sign a waiver to fully understand what they are signing their kids up for when they play football or a contact sport,\" Carson said.\n\"Most parents of little boys of color will continue to allow their kids to play,\" Carson said, \"because, you know, they don't want to deny their kids the opportunity to play because he has talent … not fully understanding that their kids may suffer the consequences down the road.\"\nThat differs somewhat from the view of Bruce Harper, a former New York Jets running back and kick returner whose NFL career lasted from 1977 to 1984. Harper never had to face a parental decision about youth football. He has two daughters, neither of whom played the sport.\nHowever, Harper said the decision should be left to the child.\n\"It's a decision each kid individually has to make. I don't think the parents should decide for the kid if they can play or not,\" he said.\nThe NFLPA has no formal policy regarding tackle football for kids. However, the players union has backed several youth initiatives including both tackle and flag football. The players union also supports members serving on the boards of USA Football and other youth leagues. Additionally, the union provides financial and community support to players running football camps for kids, but these camps primarily stay away from tackle.\n\"We encourage every level of football … to implement the health and safety protocols we have at the NFL level,\" said George Atallah, the NFLPA's assistant executive director of external affairs. \"We don't have a specific position on when we think young people should play it. That's for the medical experts to determine.\"\nFoxworth, who played for three teams from 2005-2011, sustained many injuries throughout his career. He's been able to deal with injuries to his body, but brain injury will always be something he's mindful of.\n\"I still wouldn't trade it for the life that I've had access to,\" Foxworth said of his football career. \"But it's all a different conversation when you start talking about your brain.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You might think that experts never fall from grace in this respect, but you would be wrong.Today's deal comes from a match between two different countries. How should South play in six hearts after West leads the diamond five?At the other table, North-South stopped in four hearts, making five. This pair was more adventurous. Three diamonds was a transfer bid, East doubling to show good diamonds. Throwing caution to the winds, North rebid a quantitative four notrump.(If he had wanted to ask for aces or key cards immediately, he would have used a Texas transfer at the four-level.) South, despite having minimum count and two diamond losers, took a shot at the slam.The declarer won the first trick with his diamond ace and drew trumps in three rounds. Then he paused to assess the situation - too late.He should have noted that he had only 11 winners: three spades, five hearts, one diamond and two clubs. It was necessary to capture a third club winner.The right line is to draw only two rounds of trumps, keeping an honor in the South hand. Then declarer plays off his three top spades, discarding one of dummy's clubs. A club to the ace, a club to the king and a club ruff follow. South, thankful to see the 3-3 split, plays a trump to his jack (or king) and cashes the club nine, discarding one of dummy's diamond losers. He concedes just one diamond trick. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland session concludes with balanced budget\n\n April 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Marissa Yelenik and Sofia Appolonio Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 1120\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ANNAPOLIS — Maryland lawmakers passed a budget on Monday, concluding their spring session after months of grappling with a tough fiscal reality and new federal policies.The end-of-session agreement hikes taxes and cuts programs to balance the spending plan for the 2026 fiscal year, assuming the federal funding picture does not change radically in the months to come.\nLawmakers made the budget work partly by trimming back the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, the ambitious 2021 education reform plan meant to improve public schools. Architects of the deal said the changes will preserve the Blueprint's priorities.\n\"We present a budget that puts Maryland in a strong fiscal position and faces the challenges ahead while protecting our shared values and priorities,\" said Senate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone. (D-Howard).\nBut House Minority Whip Del. Jesse Pippy (R-Frederick, Carroll) argued that the plan unnecessarily burdens taxpayers.\n\"A majority of my colleagues feel very strongly that we could have balanced the budget without raising taxes,\" Pippy said. \"I don't think the direction of the state is the direction that most Marylanders want to go in.\"\nRepublicans made their mark on legislative work in the opening months of the new presidential administration, which helped give rise to the newly formed Maryland Freedom Caucus.\nStill, the Democrat-controlled legislature generally opposed President Donald Trump's policies.\nThe state — home to the most federal workers in the country outside of Washington, D.C. — likely faces continuing challenges with the Trump administration's mass government layoffs. At present, one Democratic leader said, the number of fired workers in Maryland stands at about 11,000.\n\"We expect that number to climb to 30,000, and there are many more contractors, probably at least double that amount,\" said Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard, Montgomery).\nThe legislature might have to reconvene at some point this year to cope with unemployment and changes in federal policy affecting Maryland. For now, though, the General Assembly has settled a range of issues.\nBUDGET\nThe $67 billion spending plan addresses a significant deficit through approximately $2 billion in spending cuts and $1.6 billion in tax changes.\nThe budget raises income taxes on the state's higher earners, extends the sales tax to certain technology services and introduces a $5 tire fee. It includes two new tax brackets, increases the standard deduction, phases out itemized deductions for those in higher tax brackets and includes tax hikes on individual goods and services.\nMany lawmakers celebrated its passage, but some said increasing the standard deduction would lead to service cuts in lower-income counties that rely on the income tax of low- and middle-income residents. The finalized plan will now go to Moore for consideration.\nENERGY\nEnergy was a hot topic this session as lawmakers worked to address high energy prices. They passed a three-bill package on Monday.\nThe package focuses on new in-state energy generation, ratepayer protections and reforms, solar siting and permitting and the creation of a state energy planning office. It outlines procurement processes for nuclear, battery storage and dispatchable energy, and removes trash incineration from the state's Renewable Portfolio Standard.\n\"I think, on balance, it's a good package,\" said Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery), chair of the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment committee.\nThe package initially drew criticism from environmental advocates, who were concerned one of the bills would lead to new natural gas development in the state. But the Chesapeake Climate Action Network Action Fund praised the bill as passed, saying in a statement that it \"will likely reduce the chance of new gas plant construction in the state and … will advance a host of clean energy priorities,\" including battery storage.\nRepublican critics worry that the package doesn't do enough to help ratepayers.\nEDUCATION\nBlueprint funding was the subject of debate during the legislative session. In January, Moore proposed short-term cuts to mitigate the cost of the massive education plan, pushing back and pausing funding for different programs.\nThe education budget came under even more scrutiny late in the session when an expected $418 million in federal funds was suddenly in jeopardy. U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon announced the end of a pandemic-era fund for state educational spending.\nAs it stands, state lawmakers agreed to postpone the Blueprint requirement that teachers receive a set amount of planning every school week, delaying it for three years. Additional Blueprint funding was decreased through freezes and cuts.\nJUSTICE SYSTEM\nLawmakers passed a bill to let prisoners access medical or geriatric parole more easily by allowing them to prove they are no longer a threat to others. It would not apply to those serving life sentences without parole or those on the sex offender registry. Geriatric parole would only be available to those over 65 who have served at least 20 years of their sentence.\nLawmakers also approved the Maryland Second Look Act, which aimed to reduce the sentences of some inmates with good behavior credits.\nA proposal to scale back the state's practice of automatically sentencing teen offenders as adults in violent crimes stalled in committee. The bill faced pushback from law enforcement over concerns that the Department of Juvenile Services couldn't accommodate juveniles with \"complex problems.\"\nPRIVACY\nConcerns over the Trump administration's immigration policy encouraged some lawmakers to propose the Maryland Data Privacy Act to prevent law enforcement and other local officials from sharing sensitive data with immigration officers. The bill failed to receive enough support.\nDespite concerns about unregulated police drones, lawmakers decided not to advance a proposal to set guidelines for law enforcement uses of aerial surveillance.\nDISABILITIES\nLawmakers passed Eric's ID Law — a measure allowing individuals with invisible disabilities to include a sticker on the bottom of their license, identification or moped operator's permit. The notation is meant to improve interactions and communication with law enforcement.\nREPARATIONS\nMaryland lawmakers approved the creation of a commission to study the impact of slavery after years of debate and consideration. The Maryland Reparations Commission would make recommendations to the state legislature, providing guidance on what, if any, benefits should be given to those impacted by historical inequality by November 2027.\nSEX ABUSE\nAfter emotional deliberation, lawmakers voted to downsize the monetary compensation the state can provide for sexual abuse lawsuits, amending the amount survivors can file for under the 2023 Child Victims Act.\nGENDER-AFFIRMING CARE\nRepublicans introduced a bill that would have made it a felony for a healthcare provider to give hormone replacement therapy to any minor, but the measure did not pass.\nIf passed, the Fairness in Girls' Sports Act would have required both public schools and the nonpublic schools that compete against them to separate sports teams based on the team members' sex assigned at birth. Similar legislation has been introduced since 2022.\nThe General Assembly turned away a bill to allow \"X\" as a sex designation on birth certificates for transgender and nonbinary individuals.\nCNS reporters Rachel McCrea, Emma Tufo, Sasha Allen, Paul Kiefer, Adriana Navarro and Jack Bowman also contributed to this piece. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Simplify your Baking: Quick bread basics for beginners\n\n May 10, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Maike Corbett Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 766\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Making bread at home intimidates many home bakers who don't have tons of experience making yeast bread. Several steps are involved, and there's no guarantee of an edible end result. Plus, making bread is time-consuming. That's probably part of the reason why the global bakery market is expected to reach $9.62 billion by 2030, according to 360iResearch.It's convenient for shoppers with busy schedules to grab a loaf of bread or another pre-packaged bakery item. They're available in every grocery store, reasonably inexpensive, and the quality is consistent. However, home cooks who like to know what's in their food may still want to try their hand creating their own baked goods. Quick bread is an excellent solution to that dilemma.\nWhat Is Quick Bread?\nQuick bread is a type of bread that does not use yeast or another biological agent for leavening. These goods include pancakes, waffles, zucchini bread, banana bread, American biscuits, Southern cornbread, and more. This category also includes flatbreads like naan or tortillas.\nAccording to the Wheat Foods Council, quick breads became more popular during the mid-19th century, when baking soda and baking powder came on the market. After the Civil War started, home cooks needed bread recipes that didn't require several hours to let yeast doughs rise. The result was what we now know as quick bread.\nAmerican biscuits are one of the earliest types of quick breads, although making them before the Civil War wasn't quick. Since yeast was hard to find and expensive, bakers kneaded the dough to incorporate enough air into it so it would rise when baked. Baking powder makes the process much easier.\nWhy Quick Bread?\nQuick breads don't have to rise, and the dough doesn't always need to be kneaded. Quick bread recipes are usually easy. Since they don't require specialized techniques, they're great for beginners, including kids. Most quick bread recipes are \"dump and stir.\"\nMaking a quick bread is a good way to learn several basic cooking techniques, including correctly measuring and sifting flour. The loaves don't have to be shaped, either. The cook only needs to pour the batter into a greased baking pan.\nQuick breads yield consistent results. If the person follows the recipe, the results should come out well. It's hard to mess up quick bread. Another reason these are great starter recipes.\nQuick breads are also versatile. The recipes are forgiving; cooks can add different ingredients to suit their family's preferences. For example, if no one likes walnuts, the cook can add pecans to banana bread or omit the nuts entirely. They can also add chocolate chips or even dried blueberries or cranberries for a different take on the bread.\nAnna Chesley, with Salt in My Coffee, says, \"I make a lot of quick breads, and our favorites vary with the seasons. In spring, we love rhubarb quick bread, topped with a maple streusel crumble. In the summer months, we go through a lot of zucchini bread, and by late fall, we're so ready for cranberry orange bread — our favorite through the cold weather months.\"\nThose with a bumper crop of zucchini in their gardens often make zucchini bread in the summer. They may also try pumpkin bread if they have a pumpkin in the garden. It's a good way to use surplus vegetables so they don't go to waste.\nHealthier Choices\nIf people are concerned about gluten in their food, eat a plant-based menu, or have other dietary concerns, quick breads are a viable option. You may think quick breads are sugary and carb-heavy, but that's not always true. The best part of making a quick bread is that the cook controls the ingredients. There are low-sugar recipes and low-carb options that incorporate almond flour or another lower-carb flour to lower the carbohydrate count.\n\"We make whole food plant based oil free banana bread with dairy free chocolate chips,\" says Jacqueline Sanchez of My Plant Based Plan. \"It's a great breakfast with a side of fruit and coffee or an afternoon snack after school for the kids.\"\nQuick breads aren't necessarily loaves, either. Flatbreads are quick and a popular alternative to the standard white sandwich bread. Tiffany McCauley with The Gracious Pantry says, \"My favorite is Socca, a chickpea flatbread. It's super quick and easy to make and is totally gluten-free. It tastes great and even works as a pizza crust. I use it that way often and love it.\"\nFor those who don't have time to work with yeast bread, making quick bread is a good way to have savory or sweet baked goods that can be served for any meal.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Senior care leaders warn cuts could be ‘drastic’ for Talbot County seniors\n\n March 27, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 446\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Senior care experts warned the Talbot County Council Tuesday that state cuts could impact senior services not only in fiscal year 2026, but in the final quarter of the current fiscal year as well.Carrie Ottey, director of senior services for the Talbot County Health Department, said initial proposals from the state put $2.5 million in funding for senior care programs statewide at risk. After the Maryland Department of Aging calculated how those may be allocated to counties, Talbot faced the potential of losing $24,000 in funding this year, Ottey noted.\n\"Since we're already pretty much spent through quarter three, that would be really drastic cuts in quarter four of this year,\" Ottey said. \" … We'd have to cut off almost all of our services to our seniors in the last quarter of this year if these cuts were to go through.\"\nOttey said that state legislators are pushing for a reduction in total cuts, potentially from the $2.5 million mark to around $900,000. The trimming comes as the state is faced with an over $3 billion deficit.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher said senior care is the \"wrong place to find those savings.\"\nCouncil member Lynn Mielke denounced the potential cuts and noted Talbot County's higher-than-average age makes such funding even more crucial.\nAccording to census data, people 65-and-over accounts for 30% of Talbot County's total population. The county's average age was 50.9 in 2023 and has slightly increased each year since 2020. The national average is just under 39 years old.\n\"I think it's disgraceful what this state has done in this regard, and find it to be really ageist,\" Mielke said.\n\"Hopefully the state legislature will wake up and do the right thing by its senior citizens, who have supported them all these years,\" she later added.\nOttey said the county's senior care program has served 214 clients this year already, up from 207 last year. \"People are needing us now more than ever,\" she said.\nJennifer Marchi, vice chair of Talbot County's commission on aging, said depending on how the cuts shake out, they may return to the council at a future date with a request for up to $24,000 in contingency funding.\nTuesday, the County Council voted 4-0 to write a letter of support for senior care program funding. Council members thanked Ottey and Marchi, along with senior care leaders and workers in attendance, for their work.\n\"You've done a fabulous job at providing services,\" Mielke said.\n\"And we also know that there are senior homeless issues that are going to have to be addressed,\" she continued. \"And how are they going to be addressed if they cut back our funding for what we're already providing? It's a tragic situation.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

When she was about 5 years old, after continuously begging for a horse, her mother made her a promise. If she could raise $2,500, then she could have a horse.\nTanglao went door-to-door in her neighborhood for over four years and took any job she could. From shoveling snow to raking leaves, she was determined to have her horse. Then, at the age of 9, she brought a pillowcase filled with cash to her mother, who had completely forgotten the promise, and finally got her horse.\nEbony, Tanglao's first horse, was mean and a biter. He was forced out of horse school for bad behavior. Yet, she loved this ill-mannered horse and found joy in caring for him every day.\nFrom there on, her love for horses grew. She got another horse and another.\n\"I think they're just like my will to live,\" Tanglao said. \"There's something about them that's just part of my soul. I love them.\"\nOriginally from Lexington, Virginia, she learned of horse-drawn carriage tours in the area and begged the local business for a job over the course of years. Finally, they gave her a job that she loved. There, she decided to one day have her own horse-drawn carriage business.\nToday, Tanglao has 11 carriages, ten horses and acres to help teach people how to lead a horse-drawn carriage.\nJessie Willey, owner of Alternative Therapy, said that Tanglao's love for horses is striking to anyone who meets her, and her work ethic knows no bounds.\n\"Jessica's passion is evident through the happiness of her horses,\" Wiley said. \"I've never met a group of horses more excited to work. Jess puts her heart and soul into her horses and her business. Rain or shine … or snow, she'll be out at the barn taking care of her best friends. Her knowledge about the horse and carriage is a gift to the rapidly growing community.\"\nTanglao says doing carriage rides allows her to entertain and bring joy to all her customers. Putting on a show and making her customers laugh is what makes this job worth it.\nHer two children, both under the age of 6, share the same passion for horses. Tanglao said her children saw her around horses, and soon, their love for them became infectious.\nNow, her daughter Millie Tanglao is interested in driving horses and being around her pony, JamJam.\nWhile leading her pony to enjoy some grass, Millie shared what she loved most about horses, which included being around them, especially when they were sniffing her.\nTanglao says it's important to encourage young people's interest in animals, especially regarding activities with animals. She shared that it is uncanny how much her daughter reminds her of herself as a child. They both share the same determined love for horses.\nTanglao hopes to share her love for horses with everyone and show young girls that being driven and believing in themselves can result in achieving their dreams.\n\"I tell my daughter all the time that the words 'I can't' don't exist,\" Tanglao said. \"If you want something and you want to do something, figure it out. You can figure it out. Look at all the women who have figured it out before us. Just keep going and keep the dream alive.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Talbot County Council approves purchase of Poplar Hill Farm\n\n February 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Local News \n \n 520\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — An unsuspecting item on the Talbot County Council's Tuesday evening meeting agenda yielded a significant surprise — the council's unanimous approval for the county to purchase Poplar Hill Farm.Placed on the agenda as a nonspecific request from the county manager to approve a contract of sale to acquire property, the request asked the council to agree to purchase the 120-acre property for $6 million.\nThe newly approved purchase will take the long-proposed Poplar Hill housing development off the table.\nThe property is slated for future county use, including preservation of open space in the critical area, according to County Manager Clay Stamp.\nThe property is bounded to the north by Route 333 (Oxford Road) and to the southeast by Route 322 (Easton Bypass). It's near the Easton Club development, the small Papermill Crossing community and 197 acres owned by the Town of Easton for the Easton Woodland Park.\nCouncil President Chuck Callahan said the council began the process of looking into the opportunity to purchase the property in mid- to late December.\nThe land was appraised in January, listing with a market value of $6,990,000, Stamp said. Funding for the acquisition will come from the county's fiscal year 2024 capital project enabling legislation, which authorized the county to spend up to $6.1 million on property for county purposes.\nStamp called the council's action to acquire the property \"visionary,\" saying it opens up possibilities to address future needs, including facilities and open space. It also maintains critical areas.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher said the previous County Council had eyed a piece of the property for future county facilities, of which there is a \"huge need.\" The property's acreage and proximity to downtown Easton also made it a key purchase.\n\"I think that this is a really significant and unique opportunity, and I want to express my gratitude for the sellers for approaching us with this opportunity,\" he said. \"This is a really, really significant deal.\"\nOne possibility for the site is future county schools, Lesher said after the meeting.\n\"This leaves the county in the driver's seat for that kind of decision,\" he said.\nOriginal plans for the property, currently owned by 5001 SHR L.C., were a source of concern for Talbot County residents last year when a developer proposed turning the parcel into a mixed-use development with 456 residential units.\nMost concerns stemmed from the developer's request for a critical area growth allocation to reclassify just over half of the property from a resource conservation area to an intensely developed area due to its location within the town's critical area.\nThe critical area is land within 1,000 feet of Maryland's tidal waters and tidal wetlands.\nThe application for the 456-unit development was rescinded last August. A sketch plan for a smaller 119-unit subdivision in the same location was conditionally approved by the Easton Planning Commission in September.\nCallahan said the opportunity to purchase the property was a decision the county would be proud of for years to come.\n\"It's phenomenal,\" he said. \"It's something that we're all going to be proud of, and I'm glad this council chose to do that, that's for sure.\"\nThis story may be updated as information becomes available. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'A complicated matter with a lengthy history:' Lakeside resolutions remain pending\n\n February 4, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones | Section: Environment \n \n 2194\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Although construction for the first set of homes in the Lakeside at Trappe development is well under way — and in some places, complete — project clarifications and efforts to implement county oversight remain to be done.The long-proposed and often contentious development has been the subject of numerous legislative measures since receiving approvals on its plans for wastewater treatment in the last few years.\nAnd now, even with homes already built within Lakeside's first phase, county and state officials are still attempting to clarify some aspects of the development while trying to supervise its impacts on Talbot County as a whole.\nThree pieces of county legislation, each with at least one amendment, remain pending approval from the Talbot County Council.\nTwo are waiting for a finding of consistency from the county's Planning Commission and a recommendation from the county's Public Works Advisory Board, and are set to be discussed at a joint meeting of both bodies on Wednesday, Feb. 7, at 11 a.m.\nUnder state law, the Planning Commission is required to review and certify any amendment to the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan before the Talbot County Council can adopt the measure.\nBut if the Planning Commission can't find the legislation consistent, the council will further delay an already lengthy process of replying to requests from the Maryland Department of the Environment for specific information relating to the development.\nIf adopted, the council will submit the amendments to MDE for final review and approval, fulfilling the request to address the needed information and correct mapping errors in the original legislation approving Lakeside's wastewater treatment plant.\nIn January, Talbot County Council President Chuck Callahan acknowledged the difficulty in following the pending legislation relating to Lakeside, calling it \"a complicated matter with a lengthy history.\"\nThe council is set to hold public hearings on all three pieces of legislation at its Tuesday, Feb. 13, meeting, giving county residents an opportunity to weigh in on the unresolved measures.\nWHAT IS LAKESIDE?First proposed over 20 years ago, the planned 2,501-unit Lakeside development spans more than 850 acres off of U.S. Route 50.\nThe property was annexed into the Town of Trappe in 2003 and approved as a planned unit development in 2006.\nOwned by Trappe East Business Holdings Trust, the development is slated to have a mix of housing types, including single-family homes, townhouses and apartments, and a commercial and retail space.\nThe project's developer, Rocks Engineering, based in northern Virginia, is no stranger to building on the Eastern Shore. The company developed the Easton Club, a 342-unit neighborhood of single-family homes and townhouses.\nEaston-based Rauch Inc. also is working on the development.\nPassing by the site's entrance on Route 50, it's clear that construction is underway, and some homes are already lived in.\nAccording to Erin Braband, Trappe's town clerk, 114 building permits have been issued and 109 connections have been made to the town's existing wastewater treatment plant.\nTrappe's existing plant has the capacity to take on wastewater from the development's first 120 homes.\nThat flow will eventually be diverted to a new wastewater treatment plant serving the development, a plan approved in county legislation and via an MDE wastewater discharge permit.\nRESOLUTION 281Introduced in December 2019, Resolution 281 amended the county's comprehensive plan to reclassify certain portions of the development's property for immediate priority for water and sewer service.\nIt included capital improvements — upgrading Trappe's existing wastewater treatment plant from biological nutrient removal treatment to enhanced nutrient removal treatment to minimize nutrient discharge to the Chesapeake Bay, along with building a new wastewater treatment plant to serve Lakeside.\nThe new plant, set to be built with enriched nutrient removal technology, would use a spray irrigation system to discharge treated wastewater onto nearby fields.\nResidents were uneasy about the then-proposed legislation, which was brought forward based on a draft permit from MDE. Concerns were voiced with water quality, health and environmental impacts and the spray irrigation system.\nBut in June 2020, the Talbot County Planning Commission found the measure to be consistent with the comprehensive plan in a 3-2 vote. And in August 2020, the Talbot County Council voted 4-1 to approve the legislation with an amendment, which split the property into two sections for differences in water and sewer classifications.\nCurrent Council Vice President Pete Lesher was the lone holdout in approving the resolution, citing concerns with connecting the first 120 homes in the development to the town's existing plant, which has been in operation since 2002, before it received an upgrade.\nMDE approved the resolution that November.\nBut in a letter sent that month, the agency told the county that Resolution 281 did not provide the number of equivalent dwelling units for the different phases of the development — information needed for further assessment.\nNo deadline was initially specified for providing the agency with that information, though a push came later.\nIn December 2020, MDE issued a final wastewater discharge permit for Lakeside's new wastewater treatment plant, approving a flow of 540,000 gallons per day — the number the developer requested in its application.\nPUBLIC OUTCRYOpposition to the fully approved wastewater discharge permit came swiftly and strongly.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation and ShoreRivers filed separate petitions for judicial review of the permit, citing concerns with spray irrigation of treated wastewater and specifics of a nutrient management plan not being made available during the permit's public comment period in 2020.\nA form of relief came in the ShoreRivers case in late April 2021 when a Talbot County judge ruled to remand the permit to MDE to hold another public comment period.\nBut the outcry didn't stop there. In May 2021, Easton resident Dan Watson began pushing a petition calling for the council to rescind Resolution 281 without prejudice, meaning that Lakeside's developer could come back and ask for water and sewer approval again.\nResolution 308, the formal legislation proposing the rescission of immediate priority water and sewer approval for Lakeside, was introduced by Lesher in August 2021.\nMDE's public hearing on the draft discharge permit in October 2021 drew more than 100 upset residents to Easton to speak on the development's environmental, pollution and water quality issues.\nThe issue was made more complex when the Talbot County Planning Commission rescinded its approval of the amendment to Resolution 281 in November 2021.\nWhile the legislation to rescind Resolution 281 remained on the table, attempts were made to come to a compromise by proposing ways to lighten the burden of connecting homes to Trappe's existing wastewater treatment plant, ensure that the treated wastewater would meet enhanced nutrient removal standards and give the developer more flexibility in ways to treat the effluent.\nBut ultimately, Lesher pulled his support from Resolution 308 to void the previous legislation, and efforts to compromise failed to garner enough support from the council.\nFrustrated by perceived inaction, county residents, led by Watson, the original petitioner behind legislation rescinding Resolution 281, filed a lawsuit against the Maryland Department of the Environment in May 2022.\nThe lawsuit asked the court to compel the agency to stand behind the Planning Commission's decision of inconsistency and revoke the permit and suspend any work with a sewerage system inconsistent with the county's comprehensive plan.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Talbot County Circuit Court, was dismissed last June.\nIn late October 2022, MDE made a final determination to issue a revised discharge permit for Lakeside, approving a significantly smaller wastewater treatment plant.\nThe revised permit allows for an average flow of 100,000 gallons per day — a sharp decrease from the 540,000 gallons per day initially requested by the developer.\nThe limited flow will allow for only 400 residential units to be built, only a small portion of Lakeside's planned development. Any future expansion of the facility will require a major permit modification.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Foundation's 2021 challenge to the permit was revived after the newly revised permit was issued, but in August 2023, a Talbot County judge upheld the permit's issuance. An appeal of that decision is pending in a higher court.\nIn spite of the permit's final approval, members of the Talbot Integrity Project repeatedly requested the council introduce legislation \"resetting\" the development by recognizing the county planning commission's authority to determine consistency of amendments to the comprehensive plan.\nLesher, who had been asked to introduce the legislation, declined to do so in January 2023.\nThe legislation would not have had majority support from the council, he said, and because the Planning Commission's reversal of its consistency finding on Resolution 281 came after the measure was approved by the council, there would be no effect on what had already occurred.\nHowever, Lesher emphasized the limitations of the final permit dealing a significant setback to Lakeside — a significant win for those concerned about the project's scale and environmental impacts.\nOVERSIGHT EFFORTSWith efforts to \"reset\" Lakeside shut down, attention turned to working on ensuring county oversight to what was already approved.\nLast February, Talbot County Council member Lynn Mielke introduced legislation, known as Resolution 338, amending the county's comprehensive plan to be consistent with the provisions of Lakeside's wastewater discharge permit.\nUnder the amendment, any expansion of the new wastewater treatment plant would also require a new change to the county's comprehensive plan.\nAttorneys for Trappe and the developer opposed the requirement for the developer to come back before the county for future expansion.\nLesher and Mielke introduced an amendment to Resolution 338 in November, which adds language requiring a certification from the Talbot County Planning Commission of an expansion amendment's consistency with the comprehensive plan.\nAmended Resolution 338 was found consistent with the county's comprehensive plan in December, with commission Chairman Chip Councell saying it would be the county's only chance for review of potential expansion.\nBut even though construction is underway, thanks to Resolution 281 and the issuance of the revised discharge permit, the Maryland Department of the Environment is still seeking clarification on some specifics of the development.\nIn a series of letters sent last year, the agency reemphasized the need for the county to provide the number of equivalent dwelling units in each phase of Lakeside to assess the adequacy of the water and sewer system to accommodate and serve the development.\nTwo of the exhibits to Resolution 281 — maps displaying updates to Trappe's proposed water and sewer service areas — were in need of correction, MDE said. The maps showed additional properties not part of the Lakeside development to have incorrect water and sewer classifications.\nThe mapping issues were requested to be addressed in the form of a comprehensive plan amendment.\nThe county debated over the best way to address MDE's requests last summer, eventually settling on tackling them via comprehensive plan amendments, known as Resolution 347 and Resolution 348.\nThe original version of Resolution 347 provides the number of equivalent dwelling units — 2,874 in total across all six phases, with just over 1,200 designated for immediate water and sewer service.\nIt specified that the phases only represent land uses, not timing or sequence of development, and any changes in phasing or allocation will need to be included in amendments reclassifying any phase's water and sewer service.\nThe resolution's first amendment, introduced last November, struck the language on the phases only representing land use, clarifying that all phases not designated as immediate priority for water and sewer service will need to be reclassified before receiving service from Trappe.\nA second amendment, introduced Jan. 23, adds the provisions of Resolution 338 into the legislation.\nLesher described the inclusion of that language as an alternative to help the Planning Commission find Resolution 347 consistent with the comprehensive plan. Without that finding of consistency, the resolution can't be approved by the council, further delaying fulfillment of MDE's requests.\nResolution 348, introduced last September, was described by County Attorney Patrick Thomas as simple clarification and confirmation of the water and sewer classifications of certain parcels unrelated to Lakeside, which were incorrectly shown in two exhibits to Resolution 281.\nA resolution introduced Jan. 16 by all five council members shed light on more than just the unrelated parcels — it clarified the changes in water and sewer service status for some of Lakeside's parcels that weren't clearly specified in Resolution 281.\nMore specifically, the amendment clarified that prior to the council adopting Resolution 281, the comprehensive plan depicted a portion of Lakeside's property as immediate priority for water service, with the remainder designated as unprogrammed.\nHowever, Resolution 281 actually stated that some parcels within that portion were being redesignated from their \"current\" classification of W-2 to W-1, or immediate priority for water service.\nAnd prior to Resolution 281's approval, maps of sewer service areas in Trappe showed Lakeside's parcels as unprogrammed, the amendment said.\nBut Resolution 281 remapped a portion of Lakeside's parcels from their \"current\" classification of S-2 to immediate priority status for sewer service.\nIntended to resolve confusion and uncertainty from the state environmental agency surrounding the classifications, the amendment confirms Resolution 281 amended certain parcels on the town's water and sewer service maps from unprogrammed status to W-2 and S-2 status.\nWith review of Resolution 347 and Resolution 348 by the Planning Commission and the Public Works Advisory Board imminently approaching, the County Council could soon be facing a tough task.\nIf the resolutions, with or without amendments, are found consistent with the comprehensive plan, the council could soon grant approval, finally completing MDE's requests.\nBut if more questions remain, or if the legislation is found inconsistent, the county will return to the drawing board for further consideration and changes. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Significant increases include salary costs and fixed charges.\nTalbot County Public Schools Chief Financial Officer Sarah Jones said that $2 million is built out for 33 \"highly necessary,\" additional positions. The budget also accounts for $1.3 million in expected health insurance cost increases due to inflation and the new positions, she said.\nJones noted that while the unrestricted budget is $8.9 million higher than last year, the overall budget of $95.9 million — made up of restricted and unrestricted funds — is only up by $3.6 million. This is mostly due to a year-to-year decrease in federal grant funding.\n\"So it is not, in total, a significant increase,\" Jones said. \"There has been a significant shift from federal to … local.\"\nNext month, the district will present the budget to the Talbot County Council. The council will hold a public budget hearing in May.\nThe district will be asking the county for approximately $18.4 million in capital funding — $18.1 million for ongoing renovations at Chapel District Elementary School and $260,000 for new stadium lights at St. Michaels Middle High School.\nWednesday, Board of Education President Emily Jackson complimented Jones for her work during the budget process. She said she's comfortable with the budget while acknowledging that much is unknown in regards to the state's contributions.\n\"I will vote yes on the budget when it comes to that, because I feel like this is a very sound budget based in fact of what we do know,\" Jackson said.\nBoard Member Cynthia Jurrius said she appreciates that the budget aligns with the district's strategic goals.\n\"We do know we have some potential things down the road that may change the budget as far as what state funding we get (and) what changes may come down the road there,\" Jurrius said. \"But for what we know now, I think this is a good budget and a sound plan.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It outlines why he is \"challenging the unlawful rejection of his nomination\" and his claims that the association exceeded its authority and violated its bylaws.\nEaston Club East, a single-family home neighborhood located off of Dutchmans Lane, is home to more than 800 residents, according to its website. Its Board of Directors, made up of three to seven members, sought nomination forms for three expiring positions on Sept. 16, according to the complaint.\nElection voting takes place from Oct. 23 to Nov. 6. Wade is requesting the Circuit Court issue an injunction to prevent Easton Club East from holding its election until the court issues a judgment.\nIn Wade's filing, which also requests a declaratory judgment and temporary restraining order, he stated that residents wanting to be board candidates were \"asked\" to answer a list of questions in 100 words or less for each question.\nAfter submitting the candidate nomination form on Sept. 30 — the deadline day — to Easton Club East Community Manager Rhonda Bennett, Wade says he was asked shorten his answers to be within the 100-word limit and given until the next morning to do so.\nThe complaint states that Wade sent a revised form on Oct. 1. Later that day, the association's nominating committee informed Wade his nomination submission was rejected \"due to noncompliance\" with Easton Club East guidelines.\nFour other candidates submitted nomination forms that were accepted, three of which included responses more than 100 words, the complaint states.\n\"The unequal treatment of the Plaintiff led to the denial of his nomination and preclusion from participating in what should be a democratic process,\" the complaint reads.\nThe association's bylaws prescribe a nominating committee to collect written candidacy submissions \"within the timeframe and in the format established by the Board of Directors.\"\nBennett declined to provide comment when reached by the Star Democrat Wednesday.\nA hearing for the injunction originally scheduled for Wednesday was postponed. As of Wednesday, no replacement date had been set. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

If they are not grenade-throwers, Trump labels them RINOs, Republic In Name Only, one of his many favorite go-to insults, as if he is the sole arbiter of who gets to call themselves Republicans.Democrats blame Republicans, with the bright lights showing the reasons for that. Republicans control Congress but cannot control themselves, which means Congress is missing all the levers of power right now.They are not playing well with each other in the sandbox we call Congress.Time to get their heads out of the sandbox.Think outside the sandbox.What would you do if you were Hakeem Jefferies, the minority leader in Congress?So far, from the original battle to select a new speaker nearly a year ago-15 ballots finally installed a weak Kevin McCarthy, forced to make fake promises to the farthest of the far right - to the current rudderless ship of state, the Democrats have played it one way, entirely partisan, understandably.But our understanding has limits.In my field, conflict transformation, we might suggest getting far more inclusive, creative, and collaborative.The Democrats should be brainstorming toward solutions, not toward more adversarial dead-ends. They could easily expand on my little list: Caucus with moderate Democrats, especially those from safe districts, to see who is willing to take slight risks.Find and engage in private discussions with moderate Republicans to see about possible collaboration. Ironically, the Democrats who will virtually certainly win reelection are the best partners with Republicans who also will.Keep close count of the numbers as private talks produce willing members who want to restart Congress and actually get back to work.Find a moderate Republican who will agree to stand for speaker if guaranteed at least 217 votes.Go public, go big, get public opinion quickly on the side of those prepared to take power from the flamethrower extremists.Win the floor vote, get back to doing the business of the American people, not the firebrand business of the anti-democracy zealots.If we believe this type of thinking outside the sandbox is impossible, we quite literally are giving up and giving in to the worst ones, the ones who seek power over instead of power with.I do not claim my version of thinking outside the sandbox is the best, but I will vigorously claim that it's better than the status quo, the Great Sandbox Full Stop we see now.Tom H.

It would raise the accommodation tax, or hotel tax, from 4% to 6% in the county.\n\"Anybody who's renting a room to someone for less than four months who's considered a 'transient' would be required to collect accommodations tax,\" Vanhooser said.\nVanhooser pointed out that Talbot County's rate is the lowest in the state. Around $2 million was collected throughout the county in accommodation taxes in fiscal year 2024. If the rate had been 6%, that total would have increased to just above the $3 million mark.\nShe noted the success of the county in the tourism industry. Despite the rate remaining stagnant since 2004, Talbot County has more than doubled its accommodation tax revenue.\n\"We consider this as an indicator of our success as a tourism destination,\" Vanhooser said. \"We know people are coming here. We know we're commanding a premium price, and people are willing to pay that.\"\nIn order to raise the rate, the county needs to ask state delegates this October to bring the proposed change to the General Assembly next year. The county is looking for support from three towns, including Easton, in order to move forward.\nThe towns of Easton, St. Michaels and Oxford collect revenues from the 4% tax on all hotels and short-term rentals within respective town limits or within a mile of those limits. The county collects the tax from lodgings that don't fall in or within a mile of town limits.\n\"The county would like to hear a vote from you on whether you would support this or not, because obviously, we don't want to go to the state legislature and ask for something that you do not support,\" Vanhooser said.\nWard 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello asked if the county reached out to hotels in the area for feedback on the spike. Vanhooser said the county's tourism board has hotel representation, adding that the county is aiming to reach out to all hotels as a courtesy.\nAfter a short discussion, the council voiced support for the proposed increase, unanimously voting in favor. No formal resolution was required for the agenda item.\n\"Talbot County obviously is not unique,\" Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery said. \"But we have attractions that are not matched by our neighbors, and for that reason, I fully support raising this to 6%.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Underwater grass populations see slight decline in Bay\n\n August 8, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES | Section: Headlines \n \n 496\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Underwater grass abundance in Maryland's portion of the Chesapeake Bay — a key indicator of water quality — fell from 38,188 acres in 2023 to 36,794 acres in 2024, according to data reviewed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. This acreage remains short of the state's 2025 restoration goal of 79,800 acres.The annual survey of submerged aquatic vegetation was conducted by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science between May and October 2024.\nIn Maryland, despite an overall loss of underwater grass acreage, freshwater populations did well in 2024, and all or part of five rivers surpassed their restoration goals.\n\"The resilience we're seeing in freshwater SAV beds this year is encouraging and reflects years of targeted restoration, outreach, and monitoring,\" DNR's SAV Program Chief Brooke Landry said. \"But sharp declines in widgeon grass across the mid-Bay are concerning, especially given how quickly this species can respond to changes in water quality. These shifts underscore the need for sustained action to improve local conditions and maintain the habitats that so many Bay species rely on.\"\nSubmerged aquatic vegetation plays a critical role in the health of the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Commonly known as bay grasses, these underwater plants provide essential habitat and nursery grounds for fish, blue crabs and other aquatic life, while also improving water quality by absorbing excess nutrients, stabilizing sediments and slowing shoreline erosion. SAV also helps buffer the Bay against the impacts of climate change by sequestering carbon and reducing acidity in the water.\nIn the 2024 survey, rivers surpassing their restoration goals include the North East River at 165%, the Bush River at 133%, the Back River at 275%, the upper Chester River at 274%, and Mattawoman Creek on the Potomac at 110%.\nTwo additional segments reached 75 percent or more of their restoration goals. The northern Chesapeake Bay segment 2, which encompasses the Susquehanna Flats, reached 90% of its 12,149-acre SAV goal and the northern Chesapeake Bay segment 1, which is the area just south of the Susquehanna Flats, reached 88% of its 754-acre SAV goal.\nThe expanse of freshwater SAV populations was overshadowed by the loss of grasses in the mid-Bay, which supports underwater vegetation acclimated to slightly saltier conditions, like widgeon grass (Ruppia maritima) and sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata). Substantial losses were observed in Eastern Bay (-36%), at the mouth of the Choptank River (-41%), in the Little Choptank River (-83%), in Fishing Bay (-83%), and in Tangier Sound (-8%).\nWidgeon grass is the most widespread SAV species in the Bay due to its broad salinity tolerance. However, widgeon grass is sensitive to abrupt changes in salinity and water quality, which made it susceptible to loss after storms that delivered fresh, turbid water during the spring and early summer of 2024.\nAdditionally, reports from the department's SAV Program suggest that widgeon grass populations throughout Maryland's tributaries appear to have produced fewer seeds in 2023 than normal. Department scientists are looking into the possibility that widgeon grass seed production is impacted by abnormally high water temperatures. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

On several levels, from economic to public safety to morally and ethically, the Trump Administration's aggressive deportation campaign does not serve us well.Over 8 million unauthorized US workers contributed $73 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2022 through the use of ITIN numbers, a voluntary process since they are not eligible for Social Security numbers. Additionally, these workers paid $33.9 billion in payroll deductions to Medicare, Social Security and unemployment insurance, programs for which they are not eligible to receive benefits. Tracking down unauthorized taxpaying residents for deportation discourages the voluntary payment of taxes and drives otherwise lawful persons underground.\nResidents fearful of deportation are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement if they become witnesses to or victims of crime. This allows criminals in our community to flourish as a segment of the population becomes vulnerable to extortion, abuse and human trafficking.\nFrom a moral and ethical standpoint, the U.S. has allowed over 10 million unauthorized immigrants to remain in this country for decades – working, raising families and otherwise contributing to the strength of our communities. For most of these residents there is no path to legal residency and citizenship.\nImmigration enforcement has shifted wildly from administration to administration because we lack consistent, rational and comprehensive immigration reform. Recent attempts at bipartisan immigration policy have been scuttled by extremists who see political benefit in the current dysfunctional system. To suddenly snatch long-standing residents off the street as they go about their daily lives, as has happened in this community and many others, is cruel and places us as U.S. citizens in moral jeopardy.\nEach of us has an obligation to speak out to our elected leaders and let them know how we feel about this policy.\nMARY M.

    "content": "Local Lightning Rods: Social media, national partisan divisions, culture wars have changed tone and tenor of local politics\n\n March 1, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Mike Sunnucks APG National Enterprise Editor | Section: News \n \n 1445\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Megan Cook, Russ Nelson and Ann Groves Lloyd are mayors of small towns in Maryland, Montana and Wisconsin.Nelson has been the mayor of Belgrade, Montana, for 20 years.\nKaren Rose has been with Sarasota County Schools in Florida for more than three decades serving as a special education teacher, middle school principal and since 2020 on the local school board.\nOver their tenures, the quartet and local officials across the country have seen the exponential growth of social media and its impacts on civil discourse, as well as the increasing intersections between divisive national politics and what's happening at the community level.\nRose, who became chair of the Sarasota County School Board in November, said she's worked for and with multiple superintendents — and times have definitely changed.\n\"We took great pride in no one knowing our political affiliation. We kept each other in check. It was a matter of pride,\" Rose said.\nNow, Florida conservatives (including Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis) and progressives (including some outspoken teacher unions and Democratic-leaning school boards) clash locally over COVID and vaccine rules, controversial books in libraries, the state's so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" law restricting elementary school teachers from talking to young students about gender identity and sexual orientation and how to teach America's racial history.\nRose said she saw some previous superintendents let politics take away from the focus on academic achievement.\n\"Cultural wars were being let in and taking hold,\" she said.\nRose, a Republican, said the current superintendent, Terry Connor, (who was hired last year) has shown a focus on academic achievement and data-driven solutions.\nBut that's not stopping the politics at board meetings, she said.\n\"There is clearly an organized agenda that is political in the boardroom during public comment,\" Rose said. \"It's very organized.\"\nRose said Democratic advocates will speak during the comment period, noting a recent hearing where 67 people spoke, with only three focused on academics.\nSome of the recent comments have been geared toward Bridget Ziegler, who has served on the Sarasota school board since 2014 and was a co-founder of the lightning rod conservative education group Moms for Liberty, which has become a GOP political force.\nLiberal activists and other critics have called for Ziegler to resign her post amid a police investigation of her husband, former Florida Republican Party Chairman Christian Ziegler, over an alleged sexual encounter with his wife and another woman. Christian Ziegler could face video voyeurism charges for allegedly videotaping the encounter. Bridget Ziegler has never faced any legal allegations in the episode. She did not respond to an interview request.\nRose said political advocates, as well as some media outlets, have focused on Florida controversies, including debates over controversial and mature content at libraries. Those debates, along with fights over drag shows at libraries, other public venues and local businesses, have been happening across the country.\n\"They continue to talk about book banning. This board has not banned one single book,\" she said.\nConservative and progressive advocates increasingly view local councils and school boards as venues to mobilize supporters and address issues of concern.\nCarlos Guillermo Smith, senior policy adviser for Equality Florida (an LGBTQ rights group), said the group has \"a long history\" of mobilizing parents and community members to attend school board and council meetings when issues of concern arise.\n\"We have also had a regular presence at the Sarasota school board meetings, especially in the wake of recent Moms For Liberty/Ziegler scandals,\" he said.\nAnti-war and pro-Palestinian activists have pushed liberal jurisdictions, including San Francisco, to approve resolutions condemning Israel's war in Gaza after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks and calling for a ceasefire. Other progressives advocated for spending cuts and shifting money away from police after the death of George Floyd in 2020.\nAmong conservatives, Mark Lee Dixson, a Christian pastor and anti-abortion rights advocate from Texas, has gotten 65 cities and seven counties in Texas, Nebraska, New Mexico and other states to pass Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn Initiatives. The measures aim to signal communities' oppositionto abortion rights and resistance to having abortion clinics in their jurisdictions.\n'THAT'S MY TECHNOLOGY'\nFrustrations with and more cautious approaches related to social media are common refrains from local officials wary of viral controversies and local rumor mills.\nIn small-town Montana, where Belgrade has a population approaching 13,000 people, Nelson avoids social media and its penchant for unpleasant and contentious discourse.\n\"I'm not on Facebook. I'm not on social media,\" said Nelson, who has been in office since 2003 and won reelection in November for a final term before his expected retirement. \"You can call me, or if you need me, you can text me. That's my technology.\"\nThe more contentious nature of local politics — whether it comes from social media criticism or its mirroring of national fights over hot-button issues or former President Donald Trump — also can discourage potential candidates for local office and can lead to shorter tenures for some city, county and school district staff, Nelson said.\n\"Good people see how challenging it is and don't enter the game,\" he said.\nAnn Groves Lloyd is the mayor of Lodi, Wisconsin, a town of just over 3,200 residents near Madison. Groves Lloyd describes herself as a \"progressive feminist\" and \"small-town mayor\" on her social media profile on X (formerly Twitter).\nThe progressive mayor is a vehement critic of former President Trump, is no fan of U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and is not sure she can find compromise or common ground with conservative adherents of alt-right media such as Alex Jones or those getting worked up about drag shows.\nGroves Lloyd also said she saw already rough civil discourse get even rougher during the debates over COVID mask mandates, vaccines and shutdowns.\n\"It was pretty toxic,\" she said. \"For me, personally, I took a giant step back from social media. I used to post a lot of mostly progressive things on Facebook.\"\nNow, the Wisconsin mayor keeps her ideological posts to X, which has a national and international focus.\nShe also worries about social media rumor mills and rabbit holes leading constituents astray.\n\"From a city perspective, we just wish people would pick up the phone and call us. We are constantly fighting the rumor mill,\" she said.\nSome activists counter that local governments and school boards are not always forthcoming with information or friendly with constituents who are less connected or come from opposing political camps.\nStill, social media and live and replayed online broadcasts of meetings allow more residents and local businesses to engage with and keep tabs on local matters.\n\"The more information that we share with the public about what's happening in town, the better. We also have a live feed for all of our council, board and commission meetings. If residents aren't able to make it, they can always watch the recordings from our website,\" said Cook, mayor of Easton, on Maryland's Eastern Shore.\n\"The town is using social media as another way of sharing information with the community. It's a quick, easy and efficient way to share information,\" she said.\nEven Nelson said social media helps drive interest and council meeting attendance on hot-button issues such as \"dogs, fireworks and marijuana,\"referring to city regulations and decisions on dispensaries after Montana voters legalized cannabis for recreational use in 2020.\nPUTTING THE PARTISAN IN NONPARTISAN\nWhile many local elected offices are nonpartisan, partisan politics has increasingly become part of local elections and governance.\nIn Montana, Nelson, a self-described moderate Republican, voiced frustration with the \"far right\" conservative agenda from the state legislature impacting and dictating policy paths to local entities.\nConservative state lawmakers have passed laws requiring local school districts to open their enrollments to out-of-district students, and looked to put limits on some municipal zoning powers, including efforts to develop more affordable and multifamily units statewide.\nBack East, Easton, which has a population of close to 17,500, is part of Talbot County, which saw a contentious fight that drew national political and media attention over a Confederate statue in front of the county courthouse.\nThe Talbot Boys statue, erected in 1916, was relocated to a private memorial park in Virginia in 2022 after a vote by the county council. Cook said Easton has been able to avoid some of the wave of national divisiveness, but she has definitely seen a greater interest from Democratic and Republican groups in local races, as well as more questions from voters about her own party affiliation.\n\"In town elections, we don't run on a party system, which I love. It shouldn't matter what you're registered as, if you need assistance from the town we're going to be there,\" said Cook, a Democrat, who was elected mayor last year after serving as Town Council president.\n\"That being said, I was asked more during my last campaign what I was registered as than I have before and both Central Committees seemed to want to be involved.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I didn't shoot the whole game, but at least I made the one that mattered.\" The first half was back and forth between the two Talbot County rivals, with Easton (0-0) carrying a 13-11 lead into the second quarter, and the Sabres rallying, McCall's baseline drive with 0.2 seconds remaining giving Sts. Peter & Paul (4-2) at 25-24 lead at the break.\n\"They had that 7-0 run right at the beginning (of the game),\" Easton head coach Lesley Staehli said of her team. \"Then it was like a couple of mental errors here and there.\" But the Sabres (4-2) took control of momentum in the third quarter, outscoring the Warriors, 11-5. McCall's follow and Quade's third 3-pointer nudged Sts. Peter & Paul to a 30-24 lead early in the third. Easton answered.\nKate Adelman (11 points) hit a pair of free throws.\nAyari Granados Martinez followed suit, getting Easton (2-3) within 30-28 with 3:37. Serenity Velez (teamhigh 14 points) converted one of two, paring the lead to just one with under 2 minutes left in the third.\nBut the Sabres closed the third with a six-point burst, as Quade (game-high 17 points) canned the last of her four 3-pointers, was fouled, and hit the foul shot. Lucy Rankin then scored off a Sam Murphy assist, giving Sts. Peter & Paul a 36-29 lead with one quarter left.\n\"I think they just basically started out-rebounding us,\" Staehli said of the Sabres. \"First half we were constantly on the boards and then they just started out-rebounding us, getting better position than us to the basket.\nThat kind of gave them some second-chance shots.\" After an Adelman layup, Rankin scored on a follow to keep Sts. Peter & Paul's lead at seven. But with Quade and McCall (15 points) playing with four fouls, the Sabres offense lost traction.\nEaston took advantage. Velez made a free throw with 6:22 left. A little over two minutes later she drained a trey, cutting the deficit to three. Siang Sama connected with a pair of free throws, making it a one-point difference.\nVelez then made the second half of a two freethrow opportunity, creating a 38-38 tie with 42.2 seconds to go.\nNeither team could break the stalemate until Sam Murphy got the ball on the right side of the basket near the 3-point line. Murphy charged in, went straight up, hit the shot and was fouled, edging the Sabres ahead at 40-38.\n\"'It's crunch time,'\" said Sam Murphy, who missed the following free throw. \"'I have to take it to the hoop.' That's what I was thinking. We were just passing it around and I was like, 'OK, I've had enough of this.'\" Quade then fouled out with 8.2 seconds left, sending Adelman to the line. The Easton guard made one of two, but McCall launched an outlet pass to Rankin, whose layup punctuated the victory, sending the Sabres flooding onto the court in celebration.\n\"When the fourth quarter came around we only had six men that could really be out there at that moment in time,\" Coach Murphy said. \"We had foul trouble and we lost our momentum. So third quarter, confident.\nThen fourth quarter was a little nervous. After Sam's drive to the basket, I felt a little more confident that they knew what they needed to seal the deal.\" \n \n Caption: WILLIAM HAUFE/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Saints Peter and Paul's Avery McCall, left, hugs Sam Murphy Monday after Murphy hit the game-winning basket against Easton.\n\n WILLIAM HAUFE/STAR DEMOCRAT\n\n Saints Peter & Paul's Morgan Quade (4) scored a game-high 17 points in Monday's victory over Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After making another Lifetime film titled \"How She Caught a Killer,\" she plays the title role in the Hallmark Movies & Mysteries feature \"Guiding Emily\" Friday, Sept. 8. The telecast helps to mark National Dog Service Month, for a reason that's quite clear in the story.Based on the same-named book by Barbara Hinske, the film's Emily is a successful career woman who experiences a major crisis when an accident robs her of her eyesight.

    "content": "Chesapeake Bloom: Healing and building through flowers\n\n March 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 575\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — On Friday evening, Dede Hoopes, owner of Chesapeake Bloom, a full-service floral design studio in historic downtown Easton, hosted a flower bar.The shop welcomed residents to come by and learn how to build bouquets to celebrate International Women's Day.\nWomen poured in with friends, mothers and sisters. Each had a vase in hand and carefully reviewed the bundles of flowers they had to create their bouquets.\nHoopes said gardening and flowers have healed and changed her life. She seeks to bring that same joy to the people of the Eastern Shore.\nThis was not where she thought her life was heading. In 2015, Hoopes had a career in human resources. Due to health challenges, she turned to gardening and flowers to help her heal.\nShe decided that she wanted to be a flower farmer, and she shared her dream with her family.\n\"It seemed far-fetched at the time, but it was my husband who said I should follow my dreams — he was all in,\" Hoopes said. \"We moved and built our flower farm in Oxford. My daughters asked me why I didn't do this when they were younger. They were so excited.\"\nShe left her career in human resources. The Hoopes built a house on a quarter acre dedicated to her flower farm, which she named Oopsy Daisy Farm.\nThrough her interest in flowers, she met Samantha McCall, a fellow garden enthusiast, floral designer and her soon-to-be business partner and dear friend. They began sharing their dreams of opening their shop and made moves to make it happen. Hoopes said it happened quickly. It was an idea in December, and by March, they were in business.\nTogether, they shared their love for fresh, local and specialty flowers with the Eastern Shore. Their business grew, and even through the pandemic, they adapted by delivering hand-tied bouquets curbside to customers and avoided supply chain issues by growing local flowers.\nDue to health issues, McCall had to step away from the business in 2021. McCall and Hoopes remain best friends and are a support system for each other.\nToday, Chesapeake Bloom is in its fifth year of thriving. Hoopes said Chesapeake Bloom is an all-women business operated by five flower enthusiasts.\n\"I feel lucky to work with such motivated, smart and hardworking ladies here,\" said Madeline Poe, floral designer for Chesapeake Bloom. \"We have a great team. … This job really has been a blessing because this is where I feel at home.\"\nDuring the flower bar on Friday, Poe guided attendees to create unique and beautiful bouquets. Working alongside Pam Keeton, co-worker and master gardener, they trimmed and cut fresh flowers for attendees.\n\"It's a cheerful place,\" Keeton said. \"It's a great way to meet like-minded people. We all like to garden. Most of us are into conservation and horticulture.\"\nHoopes said she is proud of her team and business and believes that if women want to open their own businesses, they should do so with faith in themselves. Hoopes said that women tend to be hesitant to take on challenges or changes, but if they don't try, they will never succeed.\n\"This is a second act for me, and I absolutely love it,\" Hoopes said. \"I have two daughters, and if I could tell them to do it, I would say to do it. I would say go have your own business because I love it. It challenges you every day, every aspect of it at the same time. I don't think I would do anything different.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "Gluten-Free Tourism: Destinations catering to dietary restrictions\n\n March 29, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jessica Clark Wealth of Geeks | Section: Entertainment \n \n 739\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The Celiac Disease Foundation estimates one out of every 100 Americans deal with celiac disease, with untold millions more having gluten sensitivity.2024 is set to become a blockbuster year for the travel industry. But what do you do when dietary restrictions complicate travel? For gluten-free people, the world of travel may not be as complicated as they think.\nWith the constant rise in gluten intolerance, more people are demanding gluten-free options when they travel abroad, creating an entirely new sector of business for countries that may not have even considered it in decades past.\nAccording to Global Market Insights, the gluten-free market brought in 12.3 billion dollars in 2023 and is projected to increase an average of 10.1% per year through 2032. Europe has a 6.9 billion dollar gluten-free industry, also growing each year. But gluten-free foods aren't mainstream enough for people to eat with confidence anywhere they go. At least not yet.\nNavigating the Airport\nTSA allows flyers to bring dry food and snacks through the airport in their carry-on. Rather than risk the possible difficulty of finding gluten-free foods in an airport, consider bringing homemade gluten-free snacks. Grab some gluten-free crackers, fresh fruit, or gluten-free granola bars and toss them in your bag.\nWhile people should still research gluten-free restaurants in each airport, having something on hand will save a bad situation in a pinch.\nEating out With Celiac or Gluten Sensitivity\nWhen dining out, question servers about ingredients used to ensure they are gluten-free. Some surprising foods contain gluten, so asking the waitstaff before ordering is critical. In some cases, it can be appropriate to ask to speak to the chef.\nEmese Maczko of Eco Lodges Anywhere says, \"I think it is easier to eat gluten-free than it was 10-20 years ago. But you still need to plan ahead. You cannot just wing it. I never go to a place without having a list of places I can eat with locations saved on my phone. Cities are easier since there are more choices.\n\" Road trips and the countryside are harder. Despite Italy being famous for its pizza and pasta, I was surprised by the number and quality of gluten-free foods I found in restaurants. But I searched them online in advance. I would not have found them by just walking around.\"\nWhen possible, book a room or place to stay with a kitchen. Even a small kitchen can help when gluten-free foods are hard to find. A quick trip to a local market offers an abundance of gluten-free, fresh foods you can cook where you are staying.\nGluten-Free Friendly Destinations\nOrganizations have popped up worldwide to offer help to those traveling with celiac disease. Explorers can reach out to them directly for assistance in navigating their country with Celiac disease or gluten sensitivities.\nItaly for the Win\nRome, Italy, was named the number one choice for gluten-free eating by Your Celiac Guide.\nItaly, as a whole, is making strides in providing gluten-free options thanks to its Associazione Italiana Celiachia APS organization, known in English as the Italian Celiac Association. An organization that trains restaurants countrywide to cater safely to celiac needs. They provide training and workshops to chefs on cooking techniques, cross-contamination, and more.\nMore Gluten-Free Friendly Destinations\nLondon, England, with its fifteen dedicated gluten-free restaurants and bakeries, is another excellent choice for those with gluten issues. Their celiac organization, called Coeliac UK, does the same as its Italian counterpart, though without being government-backed.\nDublin, Ireland, and Edinburgh, Scotland, in addition to Hungary and Australia, deserve recognition.\nBella Bucchiotti, a travel writer at xoxoBella, says, \"As an avid traveler and someone with celiac disease, I found that Greece, French Polynesia, and Germany were great for finding gluten-free options. When you're traveling abroad, it's smart to do some research on the local food and traditional gluten-free dishes beforehand.\n\"While I've usually been able to find gluten-free food in most countries, I did face some difficulties in rural parts of Thailand and Peru due primarily to language barriers. To deal with those situations, I always bring gluten-free snacks and cards explaining my dietary needs in the local language, which helps me communicate in restaurants.\"\nDon't Stay Home\nGluten issues should never prevent people from enjoying global travel. Though gluten intolerance can add an extra step to excursions, those with food sensitivities shouldn't stay at home. With some forethought, planning, and research, travelers with dietary restrictions can find safe, gluten-free meals anywhere their heart might take them.\nThis article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Planning Commission debates resolutions on Lakeside development\n\n October 6, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1198\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON-A multihour meeting of the Talbot County Planning Commission on Wednesday tackled a trio of comprehensive water and sewer plan amendments relating to the Lakeside at Trappe development, concluding with one finding of inconsistency and two postponements.The benches in the Bradley Meeting Room were packed as the five-member planning commission mulled numerous public comments on the three resolutions proposed by the Talbot County Council over the last several months.Because the legislation amends the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan, the council sought recommendations on Resolutions 338, 347 and 348 from the public works advisory board and the planning commission. The council's own public hearings on the resolutions are scheduled for its Oct. 24 meeting.Over a dozen letters commenting on the three resolutions were submitted to the planning commission prior to Wednesday's meeting, with more comments unfolding over the course of the morning.Concerns with the long-contested development centered on Lakeside's size, the capacity of its new wastewater treatment plant, negative environmental impacts, preservation of Talbot County's rural character and Trappe's sewer service maps. Planning commissioners raised their own contentions with the resolutions as well.RESOLUTION 338Introduced in late February by Talbot County Council member Lynn Mielke, the resolution would amend the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan to be consistent with the Maryland Department of the Environment's discharge permit for Lakeside's wastewater treatment plant.The resolution would mandate that any future expansion of the new wastewater treatment plant require a comprehensive water and sewer plan amendment.The discharge permit, issued last October, is limited to the project's first phase and allows for an annual average flow of 100,000 gallons per day, or roughly250 gallons per day per equivalent dwelling unit (EDU), allowing only 400 residential units to be built.But according to the development's attorney Ryan Showalter, who testified at Thursday's meeting, the 250 gallon per day flow is a presumed flow for initial allocation of capacity and treatment. Once the plant is operational, the 100,000 gallon capacity is more likely to serve 500 to 600 houses, he said.A total of 2,501 residences are planned for the development.Showalter expressed opposition to the requirement for the developer to come back before the county for future expansion.\"The developer understands the requirement to go through a major permit modification; that process involves public hearings, public input, the County Council certainly can weigh in and comment on that, but the notion that every time the Lakeside wastewater treatment plant is required to expand, (and) should come back before the county for a water and sewer plan amendment-which is maybe another four-year process - is not acceptable to the developer,\" he said, adding: \"We would not oppose 338 if that sentence was stricken.\"Alan Girard, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation's Eastern Shore director, said the nonprofit was supportive of the resolution's intent, but questions remained as to whether the intent could be achieved as it related to the timing of development criteria.\"The resolution rightly requires an amendment to the sewer plan when a major permit modification is sought, but it's mostly silent on other timing key elements, like the sewer service area maps, the 540,000 gallon per day discharge quantity and phasing, the automatic change to 'immediate priority service status' when the land is annexed,\" he said. \"These timing elements are significant because they're linked to the major concerns the public has with this project.\"Girard urged the Planning Commission to work with the County Council to ensure the legislation's full intent was realized by updating the sewer service classifications in ways that best serve the community and environmental health.Lyndsey Ryan, Trappe's town attorney, raised similar concerns to those voiced by Showalter.\"The town feels that this is overly cumbersome and would impede their ability to smartly manage growth and orderly provide adequate public facilities for development within the Town of Trappe,\" she said.RESOLUTION 347Resolution 347, introduced on Sept. 12, was spurred by MDE's request for the number of equivalent dwelling units for all phases of the Lakeside development.The legislation provides the number of EDUs - 2,874 in total -for all six phases of the development, though the numbers for Phases 2 through 6 are estimated. The legislation includes the current water and sewer classifications.Points of concern voiced by members of the public centered on confusion with timing of the phases and water and sewer classifications for each phase.Ryan, again speaking for the Town of Trappe, said she thought there was a lot of misunderstanding about phases and planning of phases. The town never intended to require that each phase be developed before moving to a later phase; the phases were not intended to be sequential, she said.Ryan also confirmed that 81 residential units within Lakeside are being served and are connected to Trappe's existing wastewater treatment plant.On Monday, the county's public works advisory board voted 5-0 to recommend that the resolution not be adopted as written.RESOLUTION 348Resolution 348, introduced Sept. 12, was also drafted in response to MDE's request for clarification on Trappe's water and sewer service maps. The legislation addresses incorrect water and sewer classifications of parcels shown in two exhibits to Resolution 281, the original legislation approving a wastewater treatment plant for Lakeside under a draft discharge permit.The parcels that were incorrectly shown on the exhibits are unrelated to Resolution 281. The parcels' classifications were not changed, making the resolution's purpose solely to clarify and confirm the water and sewer classifications.To Easton resident Lisa Ghezzi, a former county planning commission member, the resolution signified continued confusion on Trappe's water and sewer service maps. She pointed out that the lack of updates to the county's comprehensive plan is the source of the frustration.\"We're just spinning our wheels, and we cannot make any decisions until everyone, staff included, knows the facts behind this,\" she said. \"I found confusion in staff's presentation at the outset of this discussion. (The) public works advisory board raised questions earlier this week. How can we operate like this?\"Talbot County resident Mike McConnel urged the Planning Commission to consider a revised sewer service map for Trappe that only identifies one small section of Lakeside as an immediate priority and to revert all other sections of the development to unprogrammed.\"That will mean that as Lakeside progresses, they will have to come back to the Planning Commission and establish that the consequences of the development are consistent as it goes forward,\" he said.The county's public works advisory board reviewed the resolution on Monday, but tabled a decision until the board's next meeting on Oct. 19.DECISIONSAfter significant back and forth, the Planning Commission voted 3-2 to find Resolution 338 inconsistent with the county's comprehensive water and sewer plan because it refers to a map that needs to be reviewed, but the commission endorsed the idea of a phased review, per the motion made.The commission voted unanimously to postpone its determination on Resolution 347 for further discussion.As for Resolution 348, the commission also voted unanimously to postpone consideration due to ongoing uncertainty that has not been addressed. \n \n Caption: NATALlE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nTalbot County Planning Commission Chairman Chip Councell, center, speaks about the Lakeside comprehensive water and sewer plan amendments during a meeting Wednesday, Oct. 4. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Rocking reflections: Paramount+ revisits Elvis Presley's 1968 comeback special\n\n August 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: 9A | Section: News \n \n 489\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Elvis Presley's legendary 1968 television special was a turning point not only for him, but for many of the other people involved in it.One was producer-director Steve Binder, who candidly told the \"King\" of music that the latter's career was \"in the toilet,\" so he needed to do the NBC-televised hour. The result quickly became a legendary piece of television, and Paramount+ looks back at it in the new offering \"Reinventing Elvis: The '68 Comeback,\" which starts streaming Tuesday, Aug, 15 - the night before the 46th anniversary of Presley's death, and following the project's limited showings in movie theaters globally.While incorporating many segments from the original show, \"Reinventing Elvis\" examines Presley's relationship not only with Binder (who narrates the bulk of the film), but also with Col. Tom Parker, the famously strict manager who kept tight control over Presley.Singers Darius Rucker and Drake Milligan are among those who offer comments, along with journalist Alanna Nash and Anita Mann, who was a dancer on the 1968 special.Also an executive producer of \"Reinventing Elvis,\" Binder maintains that he's \"real pleased with what they did\" creatively with the documentary, though he admits he was skeptical at first. \"When I was approached to get involved, I said, 'There are so many third-party stories about Elvis, why do we need another one?' Then they pitched me their idea, and it really covered 1968 as a whole. I was rooting for them from the sidelines, and I certainly was responsive to any of their requests for more material.\" Music-documentary veteran John Scheinfeld - who also has done projects on John Lennon, John Coltrane, Herb Alpert and Harry Nilsson - directed \"Reinventing Elvis,\" which also has music-industry legend Spencer Proffer, a longtime Binder associate, as the executive producer who conceived it.\"There are so few of us alive today who were there when it all happened,\" Binder reflects of the 1968 Elvis show. \"There have been specials and books about it, but I never felt that anybody who was there told the real story.\"I was there from the beginning to the end, and it's so gratifying today to realize what the public response to it was. A number of years ago, somebody approached me and said, 'Steve, you realize that no matter what you did in the past or do from here on in, you'll be remembered mostly for the Elvis comeback special' and I think they told the truth.\" The entirety of \"Reinventing Elvis\" serves as a reminder of how major a star Presley was in his time. \"We're so lucky that we partnered with Paramount+,\" Binder notes, \"because many of Elvis' movies were done at Paramount, so we were given access to their library and were able to include clips from his films.That was just a stroke of luck, and it sure adds to this. None of the other projects that have been done about the 1968 special were able to clear those rights, I guess.\" \n \n Caption: Elvis Presley in his 1968 comeback special \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland faced the coldest winter in six years\n\n April 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: NATALIE WEGER Capital News Service | Section: News \n \n 543\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As the cherry blossoms bloom and the days grow longer, Marylanders face the end of the winter season. This past winter brought about 13 inches of snow and temperatures dipping down to the single digits.But how did this year's Maryland winter compare to those in the past?\nAs March comes to a close, Capital News Service analyzed the state's winter snow and temperatures over past decades. For the purpose of this analysis, Maryland winter is defined as December to March.\nHere's what we found.\nHow have Maryland winter temperatures changed over the years?\nThis past winter marked the coldest season the Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport national weather station has reported in six years.\nBWI reported the average temperature between December and March so far as 39.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Last winter, the average temperature was 42.9 degrees. And six winters ago, the average temperature reached 38.5 degrees.\nWinter temperatures reported at BWI have remained largely variable\nDespite this year's cold winter, all 48 contiguous states across the nation have experienced winter warming throughout the past few decades.\nAverage winter temperatures across the 48 states have increased by about 3 degrees since 1896, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The agency's website stated that the increase, which aligns with reductions to snow and ice season, can generally be attributed to global warming.\n\"The same general trend that we've seen is still present,\" Alfredo Ruiz-Barrada, an associate research professor in the University of Maryland's atmospheric and oceanic science department said. \"The trends in temperature are increasing.\"\nWhen does Maryland typically see the most snowfall?\nAlthough January is nationally known as the snowiest month, BWI has recorded February as the snowiest month in Maryland over the past two decades.\nSince the winter of 2004-2005, the weather station has recorded about 140 inches of total snowfall in February and around 130 inches in January.\nAverage snowfall reported at BWI has fluctuated over the past two decades\nFebruary often sees the most snowfall in Maryland because it's the state's coldest month, according to James Hyde, a manager from the University of Maryland's atmospheric and oceanic science department. The state sees more snowfall in February because of influences from the Atlantic Ocean, he explained.\nWhat has Maryland snowfall looked like over the past two decades?\nMaryland has seen a handful of blizzards over the past two decades.\nThe most notable was in February 2010, when a snowstorm dubbed the \"Snowmageddon\" made history as it swept over the East Coast. The blizzard, which produced over 32 inches of snow, was the heaviest single-snowfall recorded by the Washington Dulles International Airport weather station.\nBut this past winter, BWI only recorded around 9 inches of snow in January and around 4 inches of snow in February. Still, this is the most snow that Marylanders have seen in three years. In the winter of 2021-2022, BWI reported roughly 14 inches of snow.\nIt is difficult to predict when the next blizzard will hit Maryland, since temperature and humidity conditions have to be just right, according to Ruiz-Barradas.\nYet Hyde said there is good chance another blizzard will hit Maryland within the next decade. Although Maryland has gotten \"less snowy\" since the 1800s, he said, big blizzards typically still occur every five to seven years.\nThe area is also seeing a gradual decrease in \"minor events,\" or two- to six-inch snowstorms, Hyde said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton EDC updates Town Council on foot traffic, Fire & Ice\n\n March 5, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 504\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Easton Economic Development Corporation Executive Director Holly DeKarske provided an update to the Easton Town Council Monday regarding downtown foot traffic.The corporation signed up for Placer.ai, a data tool which provides insight into foot traffic trends. Data was pulled specific to the Chesapeake Fire & Ice Festival in February, as well as year-to-year trends from 2019 to 2024.\nAccording to data provided to the council, North Washington Street saw around 9,200 visits for the two Fire & Ice Festival days this year.\nThat mark is down from around 11,300 in 2024, though this year's foot traffic was hampered by rain during the festival's second day. DeKarske said this year's foot traffic was \"good\" until the weather hiccup.\nShe added that moving forward, her office plans to keep streets open for Fire & Ice to avoid insurance and police costs that are \"really hard to recoup.\"\n\"We're going to see if we can find a way to mitigate the foot traffic and spread things out in such a way so we wouldn't have to close the streets,\" DeKarske said.\nAs for year-to-year numbers, Placer.ai data shows North Washington Street saw around 1 million visitors in 2024. That's down 4.3% compared to 2023, but up 5.6% compared to 2021.\n\"I think that tool is wonderful,\" council President Frank Gunsallus told DeKarske. \" … It was nice to see the positive growth over the last five years, so thank you for your efforts.\"\nWard 3 Councilmember David Montgomery wasn't satisfied with numbers on only foot traffic only.\n\"Foot traffic is interesting, but for economic development purposes, I think we really should be asking what the revenue generation is for our businesses,\" Montgomery said.\nDeKarske said Easton Economic Development Corporation does that by speaking to businesses after events. Montgomery asked that the town aggregate sales numbers from businesses.\n\"That's really the only way we can judge whether this is benefitting our businesses or not,\" Montgomery said. \"If you could find a way to do that, or I'd be happy to entertain a request to have a contractor that (businesses) would trust to collect data and aggregate it for us.\"\n\"Our job is to get foot traffic into town, and hopefully get the right kind of foot traffic that spends money,\" DeKarske responded. \"It is not my job to get them in your store. That is the job of the business owners.\"\nMontgomery said he'd like to bring the topic up during budget season. \"I thought we were getting benefits for our businesses from EEDC,\" he said.\n\"Yes, bringing people to town to spend money,\" said DeKarske.\nWard 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello asked DeKarske what businesses have shared regarding why retail and dining spending is slightly down. DeKarske said the cost of living and the recent presidential election year are two factors.\n\"People are just being cautious still,\" she said.\n\"We still have foot traffic coming into town, but people are dining out less,\" DeKarske added. \"And we also need people who live here to support those businesses as well. And so that has been a little bit of an issue, too.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "71-year-old spends season in Glacier National Park\n\n November 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Tom McCall | Section: News \n \n 480\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Talbot County resident Cheryl Krebeck spent a good chunk of her 72nd year in Montana's Glacier National Park. From April to October, she lived on the west side of the park in the northern Rockies.This curious woman loves to travel and is not letting a little arthritis get in the way.\n\"Traveling has been my passion, but when I turned 70, I decided I wanted this decade to be my most exciting,\" she said.\n\"I want to do more than just visit for a week or two,\" she said. \"I really wanted to get to know this park. I went online, applied and got a job. I was hired to work in a hotel that was built in 1910 by the Great Northern railroad. I was a front desk person from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.\"\nWhen she was not making coffee and being a concierge for guests, she had regular challenges — like figuring what to do when a guest accidentally set off bear spray inside the hotel.\nWhen she was not working, she got out into the park.\n\"Your best friends are the ones who have the same days off as you. You don't want to hike alone — there are a lot of grizzlies out there. That is what you are concerned with. Mountain lions could get you. I never saw one, but I had the feeling they were there,\" she said.\nThe more remote part of the park is the east side. When the snow subsides in mid June, the Sun Road opens and connects the two sides of the park.\n\"You see sharper peaks, more glaciers and more snow on top of the mountains. Most of my animal sightings were on the east side. Partly because there are less people,\" she said.\nShe hiked the Highline Trail up at Logan Pass. It reaches 6,600 feet.\n\"It was high for me. I saw a black bear on that hike. It was nice it was not a grizzly,\" she said.\nAnother aspect of the journey was that she was much older than most of her fellow workers. A lot of college students take a summer to do this.\n\"When I look back to being 19 years old, I don't think I had an appreciation for what 70 might have felt like. Some of the first hikes I went on were with young people. They were kind. It really added to it,\" she said.\nKrebeck thinks her traveling has given her a big sky kind of attitude. She loves being outside and inhaling. She is thinking a trip to the Amazon is next.\n\"It is a big world out there, and I feel like I have a perspective because I have traveled. Sometimes you meet closed-minded people and can tell they haven't been anywhere. They haven't talked to anybody from anywhere else. There is a big old world out there, and it is worth checking out,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

    "content": "New training center will provide cross-training, easier commute for first responders\n\n August 15, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 731\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — First responders are excited about the benefits a new Emergency Services Training Campus will bring to Talbot County.Construction of a 7,200-square-foot campus at 9095 Mistletoe Drive in Easton is nearing, according to Easton Volunteer Fire Department Chief Sonny Jones. Once completed, the training campus will be run by the Easton Volunteer Fire Department.\nThe department will coordinate training with the University of Maryland Fire and Rescue Institue, which provides training statewide for firefighters and EMS technicians, including advanced cardiac life support, medical training and emergency vehicle operation training.\nJones and Brian LeCates, director of the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, are looking forward to cross-training with public safety partners, including town and county police.\n\"They're great to work with, but it would be awesome to train with them before the emergency happens,\" Jones said. \"I've always said, the first time I meet one of my public safety partners, I don't want it to be at the scene of an emergency. I want to interact with them beforehand so we have a smooth, unified response to an emergency.\"\n\"This will ultimately improve the way we are able to respond to our day-to-day emergencies and our large-scale emergencies because we'll be able to train with our partners,\" LeCates said.\nA drive to Centreville, the location of the closest training facility of this type, is difficult for Talbot County firefighters who may live an hour or more away to schedule, Jones said. With a shorter commute, he expects them to take more training.\n\"Having this facility here, the University of Maryland and their adjunct instructors can host classes right at this facility,\" Jones said. \"So that someone in Tilghman, instead of having to drive 60 miles, may only have to drive 20 or 25 miles.\"\nAt an Aug. 5 Easton Town Council meeting, Jones said the construction contract has been awarded to Willow Construction. The goal is to break ground this September or October on the classroom portion of the building. The fire chief hopes to see the entire project completed before the end of 2025.\n\"We have, what we feel is an attainable goal that probably … fall to winter of next year … you may see the majority if not all of this campus done,\" Jones said.\nWard 2 Easton Town Council Member and fire department volunteer Don Abbatiello emphasized that the project is \"not being built with town money,\" but instead through fundraising. He commended the \"hard work\" from those involved in fundraising efforts.\nThe Friends of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department, a nonprofit fundraising arm of the department, has around $2 million left to raise. President Brett Whitehead said all donations through the end of September are being matched by the A. James and Alice B. Clark Foundation.\nA key feature of the facility will be a burn building, which Jones said will be made out of \"steel with special materials inside that are heat- and flame-resistant\" and allow for repeated burning that will help firefighters train in real-life scenarios.\nJones said he used to train in \"acquired structures\" that were a \"one-time deal\" for firefighter training, such as farm houses that were meant to be burned down. The burn building is designed for repeated training.\nLeCates also said the larger training center will help his department experience \"more real-world scenarios.\" \"Now we can bring in wrecked cars … and put simulated patients in them or some of our rescue mannequins in there,\" he said.\nLeCates added that prospective employees may take notice of the facility, a trend that the fire department hopes to see as well. While Jones said his priority is to \"make it easier\" on current volunteer firefighters, he acknowledges the high costs and packed work schedules that make it difficult for younger, prospective volunteers to commit to training at facilities in Centreville or Princess Anne.\n\"Now it's harder to get the younger generation,\" Jones said of the department's recruiting efforts. \"We don't have as many that want to volunteer, and the ones we do are awesome, they're absolutely awesome. They come in, they take all the required training, and they're participating just as well as anybody else.\"\n\" … We just don't have as much of an infill of younger people as we used to have.\"\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated which entity is responsible for managing the training campus. The Easton Volunteer Fire Department will be responsible for the management and operation of the facility. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Its expected attendance is around 4,000, according to the permit application. The Easton Police Department recommended approval.\nThe festival is organized by the Delmarva Pride Center and features vendors, businesses and food, with attendees lining South Harrison Street for the celebration of the LGBTQ+ community.\nCouncil President Frank Gunsallus and Councilmembers Maureen Curry, Don Abatiello and the Rev. Elmer Davis all voted for the permit's approval. Ward 3 Councilmember David Montgomery was absent from Monday's meeting.\nIn January, Gunsallus and Montgomery voted against approving the public assembly permit for 2024's event. At the time, Montgomery brought up concerns of \"overtly sexualized performances and behavior\" from dancers at the festival.\nAt the January meeting, festival organizers maintained that the dancers were professionals and not \"scantily clothed.\" The 2024 permit was narrowly approved 3-2, with Curry, Abbatiello and Davis in favor.\nMontgomery told the Star Democrat on Tuesday that if he was present at the most recent council meeting, he would have once again voted against approving the permit.\nEarlier this year, Gunsallus was heavily scrutinized by town residents for questioning whether the town should use funds to hang Pride banners and for stating the Pride flag is \"antithetical to America.\"\nBut on Monday, Gunsallus initiated the motion to approve the festival permit for 2025, which this time was passed with no back-and-forth council discussion.\nTina Jones, co-founder of the Delmarva Pride Center, thanked the council for its unanimous vote during public comment Monday evening.\n\"I know in the past we've had some difficult conversations in this room,\" Jones said. \"I'm glad to see that we have moved beyond those. And we look very much in favor of continuing to work very closely with this town.\n\"Personally for me, it's a great sign for all of our community that this has happened tonight. As Rev. Davis said at the beginning, this is a community that's made better by everybody that's here, and your vote tonight showed that.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Three teenagers were arrested following the altercations.\nThe pattern that is emerging — basketball games scheduled between the two schools at Easton High this season will be played without fans; basketball games slated for Cambridge-SD will be forfeited by Easton High. The issue came down to playing the game with limited spectators. Easton wanted to limit or play without spectators. Cambridge-SD wanted spectators allowed.\nThis past Sunday, Easton High announced on its Instagram page, \"Due to events that occurred during the EHS vs. CSD football game in the Fall, we have decided not to allow spectators at our upcoming girls and boys basketball game against CSD at Easton High School. As always, safety is a top priority. We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your support and understanding.\"\nOn Tuesday, the administrative offices of Cambridge-South Dorchester posted a statement on its Facebook page announcing Easton's decision to forfeit Thursday's boys' game at Cambridge-SD, and the Feb. 15 girls' game slated at Cambridge-SD.\n\"It is with great disappointment that we must convey this news: Easton High School has decided to forfeit the upcoming girls' and boys' basketball games scheduled to be held at Cambridge South Dorchester High School on Jan. 11 and Feb. 15,\" the statement said. \"This decision was made by Easton High School and was not influenced by Cambridge-South Dorchester High in any way.\"\nThe post went on to say, \"As a result of Easton High School's prearranged decision to forfeit these games, Cambridge South Dorchester High School will be credited with the wins for both of the boys' and girls' teams. We regret that parents, spectators and community members will not have the opportunity to witness these anticipated games.\n\"While we extend our best wishes to Easton High School, it is essential to emphasize that safety remains our top priority. We too understand the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment for all involved.\nCambridge-SD High School was closed Wednesday due to weather conditions. Phone calls to the office of Cambridge-SD athletic director Casey O'Bier went unanswered.\nOn Wednesday, Talbot County Public Schools released a second statement in an email, saying that following the football game, administrators talked with coaches, athletes and parents about safety at future events.\n\"TCPS made the difficult decision not to allow spectators at upcoming home basketball events against CSD,\" the statement read.\nHome games against Cambridge-SD will be livestreamed.\nThe statement continued that Talbot County school administrators asked that Cambridge-SD limit spectators at their home games.\n\"They chose not to,\" according to the Talbot County schools statement.\n\"Because the safety of our students and staff is always our highest priority, we have decided not to travel to CSD for the boys' and girls' basketball games on Jan. 11 and Feb. 15, thereby forfeiting those games,\" the statement read. \"We value our relationship with our Dorchester County neighbors and believe this decision is in the best interests of all of the athletes involved.\"\nThe Easton and Cambridge-SD rivalry is one of the Bayside Conference's richest, especially in football and boys' basketball.\nEntering Thursday's boys contest, Cambridge-SD (7-0 overall) was sitting atop the North Bayside with a 6-0 record and bidding for its first division title since 2020. Following the Vikings are second-place Queen Anne's (6-1) and Easton (5-1). Thursday's forfeit moves the Vikings to 8-0 overall and 7-0 in the division, while Easton slips to 6-4 overall, 5-2 division.\nThe boys' game at Easton is scheduled for Feb. 15 and will not have spectators.\nCambridge-SD's girls enter today's game at 5-2 overall, 4-2 North, trailing division leaders Queen Anne's (7-0, 6-0) and Kent Island (6-1, 6-0). Easton's girls are currently 3-6, 3-3.\nStar Democrat Reporter Natalie Jones contributed to this article. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Democratic candidate was Richardson Dilworth, the incumbent mayor of Philadelphia.\nScranton's political resume was thin. His only experience as a candidate was his successful run for Congress. Despite that, the state GOP was bullish on him after losing to Democratic candidates in two previous gubernatorial elections. They believed Scranton's success as a volunteer civic leader on economic development issues in a depressed region of a rust belt state would resonate well with voters.\nDilworth on the other hand, had a long history of political success in Philadelphia. He was elected city treasurer, district attorney and twice as mayor. His success was due in part to Philadelphia being a deep blue city with huge numbers of Democratic votes cast in local and statewide elections.\nDilworth's electoral success in Philadelphia was also based in part on a simple, but effective campaign strategy. His campaign would purchase time on a local TV station to which he would invite his opponents to a debate. He did so fully expecting his opponents would not participate. They always obliged him. As a result, he had a full hour of viewers to himself, where he reminded them not only of his accomplishments, but also repeatedly mentioned that his opponent chose not to participate in the debate.\nAs the November gubernatorial election heated up, Dilworth again rented TV time and invited Scranton to join him for a debate. He smugly assumed that Scranton, like all his previous opponents, would be a no show.\nDilworth assumed wrong.\nMinutes before airtime Scranton unexpectedly strolled into the TV studio. A surprised and angry Dilworth had a meltdown. It started when Dilworth shouted at Scranton, \"What are you doing here?\"\nDuring the debate, Dilworth peppered Scranton with insults. With thinly disguised contempt he called Scranton a phony, a coward, a Little Lord Fauntleroy, and an Ivy League Dick Nixon. Unruffled, Scranton calmly but forcefully responded with \"You, sir, are a desperate man.\"\nAll of this was captured on film and was also widely reported by the print media who were there for the debate. Even those who did not see the actual television debate read all about Dilworth's meltdown.\nThe debate was an unexpected and game changing negative branding movement for Dilworth's grace under pressure, civility and steady leadership credentials.\nBy contrast, the debate was an unexpected and game changing positive branding moment for Scranton's grace under pressure, civility and leadership credentials.\nIn November, Scranton beat Dilworth with 55% of the total statewide votes. This occurred despite strong support for Dilworth from President Kennedy who had carried Pennsylvania in the preceding statewide presidential election.\nThis is a lesson for the candidates the Republican Party and the Democratic Party eventually nominate for president in 2024.\nAmerican voters have long deserved and rarely seen a presidential election where candidates are not demonizing those who disagree with them and their supporters, by questioning their motives and their intellectual capability to make informed decisions.\nRegularly showing grace under pressure, civility, steady leadership and respect for all views during a long and often grueling campaign is the best way for candidates to earn voter's support and gain their trust to govern fairly and inclusively if elected.\nNow is the time for presidential candidates from both parties to commit to disagree on issues without being extremely disagreeable. Voters deserve nothing less.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who serves as a trusted adviser on strategy, advocacy and media matters. He lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Bands from the district's schools joined together to welcome staff, and many other students performed and introduced speakers for the gathering.\nJeremy Hillyard, the district's 2024-2025 Teacher of the Year, and Rosario Steele, the district's 2024-2025 Support Staff of the Year, were each presented with a 2025 Chevrolet Trax from Hertrich Chevy Buick GMC of Easton.\nGeneral Manager Pat Papineau thanked Hillyard, Steele and all of the district's teachers for their dedication to their professions.\n\"I imagine that a lot of people think that your guys' job starts a few minutes before the kids get there and ends a few minutes after the kids leave,\" Papineau said. \"That couldn't be farther from the truth. … It's pretty much nonstop. You're continuously trying to improve yourself, you're continuously investing in yourself, you're continuously investing in your students.\"\nHillyard, a Spanish and English second language math teacher at Easton High, and Steele, an instructional assistant for English second language students, both delivered speeches to the crowd.\n\"Each of us in this room plays an important role in our students' stories,\" Hillyard said. \"And it's our job and up to us to make that role a supporting one by always having their backs.\"\n\"This job has been the most rewarding experience in my life,\" Steele said. \"I have witnessed those students that start as ninth graders with very little English inspire me when I see them in the community after graduation.\"\nMany other awards were handed out during the event. AJ Rojas, the district's facilitator of interpretation and translation, was presented with the Wardell Brine Multicultural Award. Robin Werner, director of teaching and learning, was named winner of the Brewster Merrill Technology Award.\nNamed after a past superintendent, the J. Sam Meek Unsung Hero Award was presented to three staff members: Charlotte Compton and Heather Ewing, teachers at Easton Elementary, and George Larrimore, a bus driver since 2010.\nMOVING FORWARDDistrict Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi closed Thursday morning's festivities with a speech indicating major areas for the district to focus on. Some examples were staffing, transportation, dress code and student behavior.\n\"I believe in bite-sized chunks and taking it slow, so that it's not a lot and it doesn't seem overwhelming,\" Pepukayi said.\nShe noted that adding mentors for incoming teachers and math coaches has been successful for the district. Pepukayi said the district will begin working on a new four-year strategic plan, as the current plan wraps up in 2025.\nAt the end of her speech, Pepukayi indicated the district is maintaining its three priorities of improvement heading into the 2024-2025 school year: academic equity in math, an \"engaging\" environment for students and staff, and recruiting and retaining a more diverse staff.\n\"We're going to stay the course with these three priorities as we continue to move into this next year of transforming and performing together,\" Pepukayi said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Stephen Harvey is bringing jazz to St. Michaels\n\n January 16, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 718\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST MICHAELS — When Stephen Philip Harvey is playing the saxophone, the sounds that come from the horn of the golden instrument are lively, rhythmic and attention-grabbing.Harvey, a celebrated and well-decorated musician from the Eastern Shore, has a generational love for music.\nIts a love he shares with those running the Windon Distilling Company in St. Michaels, who have invited the musician to be a part of unveiling their newest endeavor.\nHaving just finished its 11th year of production, the distillery is opening a new event space, Golden Hour, next to its staple tasting room. Harvey will be performing a sold-out show to mark its opening Friday night.\nThe distillery's founder Jaime Windon said in a press release, \"this space is designed for showcasing the things we love the most: rum cocktails alongside brilliant and inspiring music, art and community. To be able to debut it while enjoying jazz along with our friends and neighbors in January is a dream.\"\nHarvey was raised in a family passionate about music and would perform for their local church. Raised on gospel music, he soon expanded his repertoire into jazz and gained an appreciation for gathered sounds and instruments.\nAccording to Harvey, it's not uncommon for someone in his family to break into song.\n\"My love for music is really a family love for music,\" Harvey said. \"My whole family are singers and musicians… (there are times) we would be on a walk to meet up together in a space, and then someone would be like, 'oh, let's sing this hymn,' and then we break out into four part harmony. My wife was very startled by it the first time she was at a family event.\"\nAs Harvey grew up, his curiosity in music began to change away from gospel when his high school band director encouraged him to join the jazz band. From there, his relationship with music took several twists and turns.\nWhen he got to college, his interest peaked in studying music education before choosing to focus on Western European art music, where he learned song styles of Italian, German and French musicians.\nBut it was American music through idioms of bebop, hard bop, vocal jazz and then big band jazz that made Harvey want to commit the rest of his life in exploring those sounds.\n\"It's this really interesting hobby/career where I feel like I can just do it forever and always discover new things, even looking back and going forward,\" Harvey said. \"So discovering new things as I write and discovering new things as I listen to people who have performed and recorded in the idiom before me is so cool, especially since you come from this family that loves music so much.\"\nToday, Harvey is a professional musician, composer and bandleader. He has released seven full albums throughout this career, with \"Library Card\" being his latest release.\nAdditionally, his compositions have been performed by an array of ensembles across the world including the National Youth Jazz Orchestra, ensembles at the Peabody Conservatory of Music and several universities across the nation.\nHarvey sees his upcoming performance as part of an effort to expand jazz music's presence in the area, a mission the distillery's owners are also on board with.\nWindon said she is a fan of jazz and was incredibly excited to host Harvey and his trio Sphinx as the first musical act at Windon's new event venue.\nFor Windon, Harvey has an electric presence.\n\"I have a great appreciation for jazz music of all kinds of styles, and so I liked that his music felt classic and familiar, but yet fresh,\" Windon said. \"… There's a charisma, to me, that Stephen has that I think is also reminiscent of jazz musicians that I've always known and gravitated towards.\"\nHarvey said he has performed in Easton and his concert will be his first time playing in St. Michaels. He shared that he's excited to establish himself on the Eastern Shore and share his love for jazz.\n\"My whole vibe since I've moved down here is seeing what a vacuum of jazz and Black American improvised music is on the Shore,\" Harvey said. \"There's like none, and I would love to produce as many shows as possible, whether they are in conjunction with Lyon Rum and the Golden Hour or anywhere else. I'm just excited for any opportunity to play inside of this county.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

She said that through investigation, the person was identified as Braun.\nEndzel described the content of the videos Braun pleaded guilty to distributing, which all included underage girls. Endzel said that when police executed a search and seizure warrant at Braun's residence, Braun told police that he knew he messed up.\nAfter Endzel detailed the case, Braun's attorney Holland Brownley, who is with the Talbot County Public Defender's Office, said she had no additions or corrections to Endzel's summary.\nBefore entering into a plea agreement with the state, Braun had received 34 charges. Seventeen of those charges were for promoting and distributing child pornography, and the other 17 charges were for possessing child pornography.\nAs a part of the plea agreement, the state will enter nolle prosequi for the remaining 28 charges Braun did not plead guilty to, meaning the state will not prosecute for those charges.\nThe six counts Braun pleaded guilty to each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years and a maximum fine of $25,000.\nBraun was not sentenced during the plea hearing, and a sentence hearing date has not yet been set.\nThe state recommends Braun receive a sentence of 25 years with all but six of those years suspended. The state also recommends Braun serve five years of supervised probation and be added to the sex offender registry as a tier II sex offender. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — The beloved Blue Crab Coffee Shop in St. Michaels has reopened under new ownership, but they're not new to many on the Eastern Shore. Bagery owner Matt Andrews has expanded his reach from Easton to St. Michaels with the Blue Crab.Andrews took ownership of the establishment in May, and he says he's excited to honor the history of the space.\nThe Blue Crab building was a formerly Odd Fellows Lodge, built in 1867. It was originally named the Shealtiel Lodge No. 1024. Four years after the Civil War ended, the building was renamed to the Freedom's Friend Lodge No. 1024, and is the oldest Odd Fellows Lodge remaining in Maryland.\n\"All the plates that we use are from former Odd Fellows Lodges around the country,\" Andrews said.\nHe wants to pay homage to the building's former use by learning and preserving its history through social media videos, interviews with members of the historical society, and by getting footage of some of the artifacts.\n\"We're anxious to learn more and tell people about it,\" he said.\nAlong with the interesting history that comes with the establishment, Andrews is excited to expand service beyond breakfast and lunch. He said they plan on testing out dinner service soon but want to get their footing at the new location first.\nAndrews says the community response has been overwhelmingly positive with strong feedback on the organic bread products made from scratch in Easton.\n\"All the feedback has been good about the food and the coffee and service,\" Andrews said.\nFormer Blue Crab owners Helen and Brian Herman stepped away from the restaurant in mid-April so Helen could focus on her architecture practice, Brian on his recording studio and so the two could spend more time with their three children, according to a Facebook post made by the Blue Crab in early April.\nAndrews said the Herman's still own the building and he has a good working relationship with them. \"We've had a good relationship with them over the years,\" he said. \"They have been buying bagels wholesale from the Bagery since we opened in 2018.\"\nAccording to Andrews, a majority of the menu uses the products they make in house at the Bagery and has an array of vegan options.\nBlue Crab baristas Anna Szwaja and Alyssa Skinner said the transition in ownership has been smooth. Szwaja worked for the Blue Crab's previous owners last summer, and Skinner started at the Bagery a year and a half ago.\n\"We all get along really well,\" Szwaja said. Skinner agreed, saying she really enjoys her co-workers.\n\"I like getting to know customers and people that come in regularly,\" Szwaja said as she gestured to the knitting club in the back of the restaurant. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Doncic learning it takes awhile to win\n\n June 18, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 861\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Michael Jordan needed seven seasons to win his first title. LeBron James needed nine seasons and two futile trips to the NBA Finals before he became a champion. Shaquille O'Neal got swept in his first finals. And the newly crowned champion Boston Celtics lost the finals in 2022 and lost in the Eastern Conference finals last year before breaking through now.The lesson, as everyone knows: Winning the biggest prize almost always takes time. Not always. But usually.\nSuch is the reality for Luka Doncic. At 25, he already is one of the best players in the world, if not the very best of the bunch. But he's not a champion. Not yet.\nThe wait for his first championship will extend until at least 2025, which really shouldn't be all that surprising. Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks weren't a logical pick in this series against the Celtics; one was a 50-win team that caught fire at the end of the regular season, the other was a 64-win team that was better than everyone from the very beginning. The smart money said Dallas would fall in these finals, and that's what happened. It ended Monday night in Boston, the Celtics winning 106-88, an 18-point margin for their record-setting 18th title.\n\"They're a great team. They have been together for a long time, and they had to go through everything, so we just got to look at them, see how they play, the maturity, and they have some great players,\" Doncic said when it was all over Monday night. \"We can learn from that. We've got to fight next season.\"\nLet's be clear: Losing these NBA Finals should in no way be an indictment of Doncic. He could have played better, of course. Smarter at times, for certain. He spent some of the finals arguing too often with referees. He knows that. That said, letting a finals loss take anything away from the first six years of his body of NBA work would be ridiculous.\nHe's scored 11,470 points so far, 15th most of anyone through their first six NBA seasons. Throw in his 3,472 rebounds and 3,317 assists, and Oscar Robertson is the only other player with such stats from Year 1 through Year 6. James came close. Jordan came close. But they didn't have those numbers.\nIt's not like this needs explaining, but just in case: Doncic — already a five-time All-NBA first-team selection — is on an absolute Hall of Fame trajectory.\n\"He's played as best as he can despite the circumstances, just injuries and stuff,\" Mavericks guard Kyrie Irving said earlier in these finals. \"He's been giving it his all.\"\nDoncic played through knee and ankle issues in the playoffs. He had a thoracic contusion that required painkilling injections to get through the NBA Finals. He wasn't at his best, and he would have had to be otherworldly for Dallas to have had a real chance in this series.\nHe finished the playoffs as the leader in points, rebounds and assists anyway. Not the Mavs' leader, the NBA's leader.\n\"He's one of the best players in the world, and so I think the biggest thing for him is that we all would like to be healthy, but there's going to be bumps and bruises along the way,\" Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. \"So, for him at the age of 25 to get to the finals, to be playing his basketball at the level that he's playing, now it's just being consistent. ... When you have one of the best players in the world, you should be always fighting for a championship.\"\nThe Mavs felt that Doncic was the real MVP of the league this season, and their argument was compelling even though it didn't resonate much with voters. Kidd says Doncic's greatness gets taken for granted, which may be true. When Doncic gets it going, it's must-watch TV. He makes scoring look as easy as anyone has in this generation. He's not a high-flyer like Jordan, not someone who plays with the force, flair and power like James does. But when he's on, forget it.\nHe might not be \"the\" face of the league. But he's in the conversation, especially globally. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver watched Doncic closely on the day before the finals started and, in his own words, came away with yet another \"example of how international this league is.\"\n\"Someone who grew up in Slovenia and trained in Madrid and Spain was doing interviews in three different languages,\" Silver said. \"Again, many of you spend time with him, but he's an exemplar of the modern NBA.\"\nThe Mavs bristled at criticism Doncic took during the finals, but in some ways, that's welcome-to-the-club stuff. Jordan heard doubters. James still does. The Celtics, until Monday night, did as well. They don't doubt nobodies. Comes with the territory, and Kidd hopes Doncic converts it into fuel for his future.\n\"When you're on the biggest stage, someone's got to poke a hole,\" Kidd said. \"This will only make the great ones better. When you look at … LeBron, Michael, the greats, the GOATs, they all were poked at, and they came back stronger and better. I truly believe Luka will come back stronger and better.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It is called experience.Take, for example, today's deal, which I spotted in a magazine. According to the author, many declarers at a tournament missed the best play. Unfortunately, so did the author!In the modern tournament game, North could rebid a forcing two spades. However, if your two-over-one response may be made with only 10 or 11 points, you must jump to three spades on the second round to force to game.If the defenders begin with one heart and two club tricks (in any order), followed by a third club from East, South has a nasty guess. Why, though, should West lead a club (or the heart king)?Many Wests led a trump, which ran to South's seven.Apparently, the unsuccessful declarers immediately played off four rounds of diamonds, discarding three hearts and ruffing the last in the dummy. They cashed the spade ace and led a heart off the dummy. However, East won with the ace, gave his partner a diamond overruff and collected two club tricks to defeat the contract.The writer recommends ruffing the diamond six at trick two. Then he cashes dummy's last top trump and leads a heart. However, if East has the nerve to play low, West can win with the king and switch to clubs.The third round of clubs promotes West's spade jack as the fourth defensive trick.Attacking clubs immediately works, but an expert would almost subconsciously lead the heart queen from hand at trick two, opening communications. Given the initial spade lead, now no defense can cause problems. ©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

By approving this, they have cleared the way for the Trappe Town Council to vote on this phase of the Lakeside development.The commissioners approved Phase 1D of the subdivision revision, with the notation that the areas identified as public open space on the plat would be clearly labeled as such.\nTrappe Attorney Lyndsey Ryan stated that open space is defined as active and passive open space for public use and enjoyment.\nRobert Rauch, president of Rauch Inc., the engineering, architecture, and environmental firm constructing the Lakeside development, told the commission that there may be some confusion about the distinction between public open space and private space.\nRauch wanted to ensure that the areas labeled as public open spaces were properly understood to be used by the public.\nThe open space would not be within stormwater management. Rauch explained that the areas in the exhibit will be green open areas for \"throwing frisbees.\" The exhibit has two parks: Lakeside Public Park and Wooden Public Park. There is public access to the sidewalks between the two areas by trails.\nOpen space areas would be under the homeowner's association's mandate and management, regardless of whether they are designated as public or private. Rauch clarified that for any areas designated as public open space, the HOA would have the obligation to provide a permanent and perpetual public easement for access and use.\nThe development agreement states that the public shall have a permanent and perpetual easement to use and enjoy the open space, which may not be limited by the petitioner or any HOA.\nThe commission voted to approve the revisions of the subdivision to make sure that all designed public spaces were clearly labeled.\nCannabis\nOrdinance 1-2024, an ordinance for the town of Trappe to establish reasonable zoning regulations for cannabis businesses, was also approved by the Planning Commission and will be recommended to the Town Council for approval.\nMargaret English, a resident of Trappe, was a vocal advocate against approving the zoning regulations for cannabis businesses.\n\"I don't think you should recommend it,\" English said. \"I don't want drugs in my town, and I ain't moving.\"\nCommissioner Edgar Harrison noted regardless of whether or not he agreed with her; he didn't think the state would permit the town to outlaw the introduction of cannabis businesses into town. After the meeting, he sat down with English and listened to her concerns regarding cannabis. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The board also approved an ordinance establishing zoning regulations for cannabis businesses and approved the proposed contract with International Computer Services Incorporated for IT work.DUPONT RESIGNATIONCommission President David Breimhurst announced the resignation of Commissioner Thomas \"Tad\" duPont. Breimhurst stated that duPont's resignation was due to health reasons.\nDuPont submitted a letter of resignation on Feb. 6 that Breimhurst read to those at Wednesday's meeting. In the letter, duPont recounted the \"challenging\" three years and nine months the board had while he was in office. Among the challenges duPont listed were navigating the pandemic, creating budgets and many other efforts.\n\"It has been a pleasure to serve, and (I) wish all continued success,\" stated duPont's letter.\nDuPont was most recently elected to serve as a town commissioner in July 2020. He first served as a commissioner from 2010 until resigning in August 2013 over concerns with an ethics ordinance, according to prior Star Democrat reporting.\nThe vacancy on the town commission came three months shy of the town's upcoming election. Three seats, including duPont's, will be up for grabs on May 6.\nBut because duPont's resignation came within 90 days of the next regular election, the vacancy will remain unfilled until the election, according to the town's charter.\nWhen Breimhurst finished reading the letter, he added a personal note on how grateful he was to serve alongside duPont.\n\"I thank Tad for his dedication and devotion to the town of St. Michaels. His love for the town is never ending,\" Breimhurst said.\nCANNABIS BUSINESSES ZONINGThe Commissioners unanimously approved an ordinance changing zoning regulations for cannabis businesses that would permit cannabis dispensaries and processing facilities as a special exception in St. Michaels' general commercial zoning districts.\nThese changes would allow the zoning board to review each application based on factors such as noise, parking and compatibility with the neighborhood.\nA nine-month cannabis moratorium, which temporarily blocked applications, site plans, permits, construction, processing and approval for businesses looking to manufacture or sell recreational or medicinal cannabis in St. Michaels will run its course at the end of the month.\nICSI CONTRACTThe Commissioners voted to renew St. Michaels' contract with International Computer Services Incorporated to assist with the town's IT services. ICSI is the town's current IT consultant and is under contract for another year and a half.\nTown Manager Rob Straubel recommended the approval of the ICSI proposal because it will avoid issues with having multiple service providers and separate maintenance contracts.\nOTHER TOWN BUSINESSMike Bibb, a member of the Talbot County Police Accountability Board, presented an annual review of actions taken by the Accountability Board, established in January 2023.\nThis board comprises two parts — the Policy and Procedure Committee and the Accountability and Charging Committee.\nThe Accountability and Charging Committee reviewed 50 complaints filed, and Bidd stated that no cases were made against law enforcement from St. Michael's.\nThe challenges faced by the Police Accountability Board included police recruiting and retention and new juvenile justice laws that make it more difficult to charge juveniles for crimes, Bidd said. He advocated for improved police training and changing laws regarding the statute of limitations for police misconduct charges.\nThe commissioners then discussed reviewing the town's ethics code.\nStraubel recommended developing a board to review the code. The board will comprise five people: one to be a commissioner and four to be community members. The commission will post an announcement to the general public in ConstantContact for volunteers. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Event organizers plan to distribute American flags for spectators to wave.\nBut beyond event attendance, the Vietnam veterans behind the event are hoping to gather parade participants and gain assistance with transportation for veterans who are unable to walk the parade route.\n\"We need transportation, but we don't want a bus. We want something where people can see them, the public can wave to them,\" Timms said.\n\"What we're looking for is people to participate,\" added Wayne Hall, president of the VFW's Vietnam Veterans Chapter. \"If anybody has any military vehicles, the collectors, we'd be glad to have them.\"\nThose who wish to be involved in the event can contact 410-310-5748. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They brought along the Special Olympics torch, called the Flame of Hope, as they traversed the downtown streets of Easton.\nOfficers from the Easton Police Department and Talbot County Sheriff's Office, as well as local officials such as Easton Mayor Megan Cook and Talbot County Council member Dave Stepp, participated in the event. Some local organizations stood outside to cheer on the athletes, including employees from the Town of Easton offices and Rauch Inc.\nWalking down Harrison Street, athlete Hannah McNiece beamed with joy alongside Easton officer Cordero Proctor, as the two each placed a hand on the torch and led the entourage of athletes to the finish line at the Easton Volunteer Fire Department.\nSome officers and athletes took a running route through town and caught up with the walkers toward the finish.\nJill Garvey, management assistant for the Easton Police Department, helps organize the torch run. She said it means a lot when the athletes interact with law enforcement and build relationships with the officers.\nOther counties across the state participate in the torch tradition. Also on Tuesday, Queen Anne's County police officers joined with Kent Island High School students for the Law Enforcement Torch Run.\n\"This event is about more than a run, it's about promoting inclusion, dignity, and respect for every athlete,\" said Queen Anne's Sheriff Gary Hofmann in a press release. \"We're honored to be part of this tradition and proud to stand alongside our partners and students in support of such a meaningful cause.\"\nThe Summer Games for Special Olympics Maryland athletes is set to take place this weekend at Towson University from Friday to Sunday. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The goal is to prevent crime and have people know the officers and emergency services personnel who serve their area.\nMegan Coxon, a sergeant with the Easton Police Department, has been a primary force in organizing the event.\n\"We are here for First Night Out, which is a nationwide event. It happens the first Tuesday in August. I probably know half the folks here just because we interact on a daily anyway,\" Coxon said. \"It is like a mini reunion. We get to hang out for a night, and of course you get to meet new people. If I don't know you, I will come talk to you and if I have seen you before, we will reconnect.\"\nShe said she got a lot of help from Jill Garvey, an EPD management assistant, and Lorraine Gould, director of Easton Parks and Recreation.\nCoxon pointed out the law enforcement representatives in attendance.\n\"We have at least ten from EPD. We have sheriff's office, fire marshall's office, Natural Resources Police, Talbot Sheriff's office and MSP. There are about 40 people,\" she said.\nOver a smoking hot grill with about 50 burgers were members of the Easton Volunteer Fire Department.\n\"We are cooking some good burgers. We got some good hot dogs. We got a decent crowd of people, it is its a good time,\" Aiden Lowery, a firefighter and EMT said.\nMayor Megan Cook was also present, immersed in community.\n\"Talking to people? That is the best part of my job,\" Cook said. \"The sense of community is what is important tonight. I think to see the police department as partners and to get them visible in the community so our neighbors know that they are a resource and they are there to help.\"\nJohn Grothe of the state's fire marshal office had a full kevlar and ballistic shield bomb squad suit and special helmet on display. He is a bomb tech and said the suit weighs 100 pounds.\n\"In the event that there is a device or suspicious package, we try to stay as remote as possible. We try to utilize our bomb robot, but every once in a while, we have to put on the suit and go downrange in person. Night Out is a great opportunity to meet people and have them come up and touch the equipment. We get to explain what we do. It puts a face to the agency,\" Grothe said.\nThere were over 100 community members wandering around, getting food, visiting with friends and getting information from the community service booths.\nJessica Carter, who was sharing an shaved ice with her daughter, said the National Night Out event gives her family an opportunity to see what resources are available to them.\n\"We come every year. The resources. Giving back to the community. Some people may not know what resources are available to them. So it is good. I like the health department and Chesapeake Voyagers,\" Carter said.\nGarvey said she has been working on this event for over a month. She had two massive sheet cakes from Cordova Bakery in her air conditioned vehicle.\n\"It falls into place. I have been planning these for 18 years. It is a free fun family event. The pool is open. Come out and enjoy. There is free food. It is a good community event,\" she said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Decline of civil dialog in society is a threat\n\n July 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 753\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Every Sunday when I was a child, we eagerly awaited the delivery of the Sunday newspaper. It always included a feature with riveting pictures from previous editions.They were not just a collage of all the pictures from previous editions.\nThey were selected by the newspaper's editors thinking not so much on how timely they were at the present, but how timeless they might be going forward.\nIf that program were still in place today, two pictures that most certainly would be selected would be from the 2024 presidential election campaign.\nOne is of former President and current presidential candidate Donald Trump after an attempted assassination at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\nIn that surreal picture, Trump is being taken with a bloody hand on a wounded ear, blood on his face and his other hand raised as a defiant fist from the event stage by Secret Service agents.\nAnother picture would be from the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\nIn that picture, Trump is standing alone on a stage next to the helmet and bunker coat of Corey Comperatore, who was a volunteer firefighter and Trump supporter who attended the Pennsylvania rally.\nCorey died shielding his family from the fusillade that almost killed Trump and seriously wounded two other rally attendees.\nProminently displayed next to Corey's bunker coat and helmet is an American flag.\nTrump appears to be gazing with deep contemplation of and reverence for the memorial for Comperatore.\nIn deeply divided America, both pictures are generating widely different reactions.\nSome Trump detractors claim the assassination was preplanned to generate support for the Trump campaign. They have implied Trump exiting the stage largely under his own power was done to show a stark contrast to a former opponent who often stumbled and needed assistance while walking.\nSome Trump detractors claim the picture of Trump looking at the Comperatore's memorial was staged for nothing more than scoring political points. They question if Trump's hand on the shoulder of the turnout coat was orchestrated and insincere.\nSadly, a significant number of seriously deranged Trump adversaries have posted messages on social media with messages like \"sorry the shooter missed\" and \"hope he [Trump] is killed the next time.\"\nI found the vileness and hate in those messages so disturbing I couldn't read all of them.\nNot all those adversaries are radical fringe malcontents.\nThey include a wide range of elected officials, celebrities and political commentators who have regularly characterized and continue to characterize Donald Trump as a Nazi, a neo-Nazi, a fascist, a dictator wanna be and an existential threat to America.\nSome Trump supporters believe the attempted assassination was a deep state conspiracy.\nThey maintain the spectacular failure of security at the event was by design.\nThey also believe constant inflammatory comments from Trump's many adversaries created an environment where the question on an assassination attempt was not if, but when.\nI am not going to engage a debate on the credibility on either side on these deeply held beliefs.\nI am more concerned such debate affirms that an alarming and steady decline of civil dialogue in our society is the greatest existential threat to democracy in America.\nIn today's intensely polarized political environment, it is considered normal and acceptable to disagree by being viciously disagreeable, to listen only to those who share and affirm that their views are the right views. Worst of all, we expect and accept the practice of demonizing anyone, and everyone who doesn't agree with us on every issue all the time.\nWe desperately need a renewed national commitment to critical thinking, listening to others, avoiding group think, respect for differing opinions and acceptance of a system of government where the majority rules, even when that can and does result in public policy decisions that do not have universal agreement.\nMuch easier said than done.\nThe underlying reality of where we are as a society is best captured by the cogent observation of veteran political communications consultant, Frank Luntz: \"It's not what you say or write, it's what people hear or read. You can have the best message in the world, but the person on the receiving end will always understand it through the prism of their own emotions, preconceptions, prejudices and preexisting beliefs.\"\nIn other words — my mind is made up. Don't try to persuade me otherwise with facts.\nWhen dealing the deep divisions caused by the issue of slavery and the American Civil War Abraham Lincoln said, \"A house divided cannot stand.\"\nAmerica has been and is a house divided.\nIf we do not change course soon, we will not stand.\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Violence is everywhere, so are those fighting it\n\n August 17, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: RIVERA SUN | Section: Columns \n \n 688\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n I'm tired of the violence. Aren't you?Some days, it seems relentless. A mass shooting at a school. Another youth killed by gun violence. A family on the street after fleeing an abusive partner. A genocide halfway around the world. Brutal wars displacing millions.\nWhen will the violence stop?\nThe answer is: When we take action to stop it, together.\nIt's not impossible. Communities across the country and around the world are showing us how. Violence may be everywhere, but so are the people trying to stop it. And many of them have powerful antidotes to the violence we face.\nDuring the Campaign Nonviolence Action Days, Sept 21-Oct 2, tens of thousands of people will show everyone that another world is possible.\nWhat does a nonviolent world look like? It's not all roses. Conflict happens — but we have better ways to respond without resorting to violence. Many of these strategies will be on display during the upcoming Action Days: Neighborhood safety patrols to prevent gun violence. Unarmed peace teams de-escalating tension in hot conflict zones worldwide. Anti-bullying programs aimed at preventing the next school shooter. Centers that help mothers and families get back on their feet after leaving abusive situations. Protests pushing banks to divest from weapons.\nMore than 4,438 actions and events are planned across the United States and around the world to \"build a culture of peace and active nonviolence, free from war, poverty, racism, and environmental destruction.\"\nAn 11-year-old movement, Campaign Nonviolence aims to end violence in its many forms. This includes direct or physical violence (fights, bullying, war, gun violence) and it also includes systemic violence (houselessness, hunger, mass incarceration and the climate crisis). Going even further, the effort seeks to transform cultural violence as well, the beliefs, attitudes and values that lead to harm and destruction, such as militarism, racism, sexism, xenophobia and homophobia.\nInstead, Campaign Nonviolence rallies hundreds of groups and organizations who use nonviolent action and promote nonviolent solutions. Sandy Hook Promise trains thousands of schoolchildren in how to counter social isolation — a factor in mass shootings — with Start With Hello Week. The Nobel Prize-winning International Campaign Against Nuclear Weapons coordinates hundreds of actions to move money out of nukes. The Global Silent Minute synchronizes thousands of people for a moment of prayerful silence for peace on the International Day of Peace, Sept 21. Nonviolent Peaceforce and Cure Violence use de-escalation techniques in conflict zones worldwide to prevent attacks.\nLocal community groups take powerful action in their neighborhoods. Nonviolent Opelika, Alabama, (part of the nationwide Nonviolent Cities Project) offers trainings and talks on their neighborhood patrols to prevent gun violence. Groups in Honolulu reaffirm their Zone of Peace and Nonviolence in a low-income public housing complex. An elementary school in Little Rock, Arkansas, holds a peace march with all the children. In Detroit, Meta Peace Team trains an entire high school in de-escalation skills.\nThere are street theater protests at military bases and teach-ins on nonviolent history, such as M.K. Gandhi or Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers. There are peace art contests and concerts in public parks. There are marches for ceasefires in Gaza and Ukraine. There are actions to stop environmental destruction and the climate crisis.\nCampaign Nonviolence is gearing up for its largest-ever Action Days stretching between the International Day of Peace Sept 21 to the International Day of Nonviolence on Oct 2. In 2023, more than 5,000 actions were held. With weeks to go, there are already 4,438 actions planned for 2024, and hundreds more expected to be added. The campaign calls for a range of nonviolent actions to be used during the 12 days, including labor strike solidarity, divestment from fossil fuels and weapons, racial healing circles, nonviolence teach-ins, peace demonstrations, and violence de-escalation trainings.\nWhen the violence of our world weighs on your heart, connect to the people working to change it. They bring practical solutions and real-life experience. They persist in showing that something else is possible. They invite you to be part of the solution.\nRivera Sun has written numerous books. She is the editor of Nonviolence News, program coordinator for Campaign Nonviolence, and a nationwide trainer in strategy for nonviolent campaigns. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "History is filled with many 'what if' questions\n\n July 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 822\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Those who study history regularly ask the question — what if? What if certain watershed events in American history had never occurred or had occurred much differently?One such watershed event was the war in Vietnam.\nHistorians to this day ask what if decisions made on escalating or de-escalating that war had been made by President John Kennedy and not by President Lyndon Johnson.\nMilitary historian Fred Kaplan makes a compelling case that if Kennedy had not been assassinated in November 1963, the outcome and duration of that war would have been much different.\nKaplan makes his case based on Kennedy's actions and decisions during the biggest crisis of his presidency — the Cuban Missile Crisis.\nPrior to that crisis, Kennedy's leadership capabilities were challenged regularly by his opponents. They were especially scornful of his disastrous Bay of Pig's invasion of Cuba in April 1961 and his disastrous summit meeting with Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev in June 1961. Following that summit Kennedy privately acknowledged \"he just beat the hell out of me.\"\nPerhaps those two events emboldened Khrushchev to place Soviet medium- and long-range nuclear missiles in Cuba in October 1962.\nThat decision resulted a 13-day period where World War III between America and the Soviet Union was more likely than ever before or since.\nThe fact that it did not is a testament to Kennedy's masterful leadership skills.\nWhen Kennedy was made aware of that grave threat to from nuclear missiles less than 90 miles from America, he assembled a group of civilian and military advisors to evaluate and oversee an appropriate American response.\nThose advisers included the eight members of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Undersecretary of State George Ball and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.\nWith one exception (George Ball), Kennedy's advisers strongly supported direct military action including bombing the missile sites and invading Cuba.\nAfter 13 days of a tense standoff between the two superpowers, Khrushchev secretly and unexpectedly offered a deal to end the crisis. The deal terms were Russia would remove their nuclear missiles in Cuba that were pointed at American targets if America would remove American nuclear missiles in Turkey pointed at targets in the Soviet Union\nKennedy's advisers with one exception (Ball) vehemently opposed the deal. They continued to support plans drawn up by the military and Defense Secretary McNamara that called for 500 conventional bombing sorties of the Soviet missile sites and air bases daily for seven days, followed by an invasion of Cuba.\nFollowing receipt of the Khrushchev offer McGeorge Bundy bluntly told Kennedy — \"I think we should tell you … the universal assessment of everyone in the government who's connected with the alliance problem (NATO) is if we appear to be trading the defense of Turkey for the threat in Cuba, we will face a radical decline.\" Secretary McNamara ended his review of suggested next steps with \"before we attack Cuba.\"\nAfter listening to his adviser's opinions Kennedy, told them \"I'm just thinking about what we're going to have to do in a day or so. … Five hundred sorties … and possibly an invasion, all because we wouldn't take missiles out of Turkey. And we all know how quickly everybody's courage goes when the blood starts to flow, and that's what's going to happen in NATO … when we start these things and the Soviets grab Berlin, and everybody's going to say, 'Well, this Khrushchev offer was a pretty good proposition.\"\nKennedy knew that the American missiles in Turkey were rapidly becoming obsolete and had no long-term military value to America.\nHe told his advisers calmly but resolutely he was sending his brother Bobby (who bitterly opposed the deal) to tell the Soviet ambassador to the United States that America was accepting the Khrushchev proposal.\nIt was a moment reminiscent of a Cabinet Meeting in the White House 100 years earlier when President Lincoln polled his cabinet members on his proposed new battle strategy for the Civil war. Every member of Lincoln's Cabinet voted no. Lincoln said \"I vote aye. The ayes win.\"\nKennedy obviously knew that as commander in chief he could overrule his advisers when he chose to do so.\nFollowing Kennedys assassination, Lyndon Johnson was either unwilling or unable to overrule his advisers on their repeated calls to escalate the war in Vietnam. Ironically, many of those advisers (except again George Ball) repeatedly advised Johnson for escalation in Vietnam were the same advisers overruled by Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis.\nKaplan's answer to the \"what if\" question on the course of Vietnam war is LBJ plunged deeply into the war and JFK would not have.\nBased on Kaplan's analysis of what if JFK had lived, America would have avoided the great tragedy of a futile and immensely divisive war that resulted in more than 58,000 American deaths and countless veterans returning home with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nI agree.\nDavid Reel is a public relations and public affairs consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "When life gives you tomatoes\n\n August 16, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: A11 | Section: News \n \n 465\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Too many tomatoes are never a problem. Perhaps the only challenge is maintaining self-control when passing the colorful piles of peak-season tomatoes at the market.Admittedly, they are hard to resist. Cherries, heirlooms and Early Girls in vibrant shades of the sun and summer challenge restraint. It's easy to be greedy and fill the basket with an array of these beauties without a plan for how to use them. While I am not here to judge or to advise you on any indulgence issues, I do have a recipe to help you use your exuberant surplus.This recipe is a wonderful summer salad with ingredients that scream \"garden-fresh.\" You might be tempted to call it a pasta salad, but as you can see, the emphasis is on the vegetables rather than a carbladen bowl of pasta interspersed with a few green leaves. Dainty orzo steps into the pasta role. Its petite rice shape won't overwhelm the bowl, allowing the tomatoes and greens to shine as they should. Fresh, creamy mozzarella and zippy Parmigiano-Reggiano round out the flavors, with a balsamic drizzle that binds the salad with a sweet and puckery kick.Serve the salad slightly warm or at room temperature.You can cook the orzo in advance and refrigerate until assembling the salad.TOMATO, ARUGULA AND ORZO SALADActive time: 20 minutes Total time: 20 minutes, plus cooling time for the orzo Yield: Serves 4 Dressing:2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 garlic clove, minced 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil Salad:1 1/3 cups orzo 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 3 ounces baby arugula, about 4 packed cups 6 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut or torn into bite-size pieces 8 to 10 ounces cherry tomatoes, halved 1/4 cup pitted Kalamata olives, halved 1/4 cup fresh basil leaves, plus more for garnish 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese Freshly ground black pepper Whisk the vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Add the oil and whisk to emulsify.Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Add the orzo and cook until al dente, about 7 minutes.Drain. Transfer the orzo to a large, shallow serving bowl and stir in the oil and salt.Cool to lukewarm or room temperature. (Alternatively, refrigerate the pasta until use. Let stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes before assembling the salad.)Spread the arugula over the pasta, then add the mozzarella, tomatoes, olives and basil. Drizzle half of the dressing over the salad and gently mix to combine. Garnish with additional basil, the Parmigiano-Reggiano and a generous grind of black pepper. Drizzle with additional dressing to taste. Serve immediately.Lynda Balslev is an award-winning writer, cookbook author, and recipe developer based in northern California.Visit TasteFood at Taste-Foodblog.com.© 2023 LYN DA BALSLEV DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION \n \n Caption: LYNDA BALSLEV/TASTEFOOD\n \nTomato, Arugula and Orzo Salad \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Kevin Bateman received 30 votes.Phoenix said 140 absentee ballots remain to be counted Wednesday afternoon. Gunsallus holds a 139-vote lead over Willey.A steady flow of voters poured into Easton's firehouse Tuesday as residents cast their ballots for the next president of the Town Council. Just over 1,900 ballots were cast during in-person voting.Early in the morning, candidates for Easton Town Council president stood beneath tents as a stream of voters passed them by. There wasn't a hard sell, it was more of a morning greeting as the light slanted onto the firehouse. Voters went in and did their civic duty. There weren't big lines at 9 a.m.Turnout at the polls was busy and steady as election day progressed, Phoenix said.But in this contentious election cycle, agitation simmered just beneath the surface between some of the candidates.Al Silverstein sat alone while the other three - Frank Gunsallus, Kevin Bateman, and former Mayor Robert Willey - spoke amiably. There was even a minor turf war when Gunsallus placed a sign too close to Silverstein's camp. Within seconds it got moved back and replanted.Willey, a former town council president and mayor himself, has been running for office in Easton since 1992. He brought doughnuts.As a longtime local politician, Willey knew there would be a lot to do early on election morning. He knew the day would be long as well, especially in waiting on a vote tally.\"But this election has gotten to be a little more demanding than some in the past,\" he said. \"I hope (when) it is over with everybody (can) still talk to each other when they leave.\" \"This is my 10th election,\" he said. \"This has become the most pointed, the most mean-spirited. I would not want to go through this again.\" Willey said win or lose, this was his last run.Leaning on a tent pole was Bateman.\"It is a relief to have election day here, especially after the last two weeks. All the hate mailers and hate speech have gone forth,\" he said.\"I want to see that Easton is governed equally for all of Easton - not just certain communities, but that all communities are included.\" Gunsallus said he was feeling good about the election, mentioning that he heard positive feedback from the community.\"I am thankful to everyone who has shown support and for all the amazing people I have met along the way,\" he said. \"Irregardless of what happens, I am happy to have had this experience.\" Silverstein stood up to greet each voter as they passed. Some stopped to voice their support.A former councilman serving Easton's Ward 1, Silverstein said it's exciting to be outside the polls on election day and to thank the electorate for coming out.\"I would encourage anybody who wants to change their community for the better to throw their hat in the ring,\" he said. \"I congratulate all my opponents for getting out there and getting their positions known. I think it is the greatest part of the American system.\" One community member, Shari Wilcoxon, was fired up enough to hold a Gunsallus sign in front of her car.\"What happens in the Town of Easton matters greatly to Talbot County,\" she said. \"I think it is time for some new leadership.\" Carol Voyles of Easton was happy to vote and do her civic duty.\"It troubles me that our communities are so divided,\" she said. \"When it is over, we are going to celebrate.\" \n \n Caption: TOM MCCALL/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nFormer Easton Mayor Robert Willey gets out his signs the morning of the election for town council president.

It is very interesting to consider what people seem most passionate about.Everyone seems to be passionate about something.\nAs Christians, we are passionate about many things — God, family, rights, the list can go on and on. But how many of us Christians (followers of Christ) are passionate about Jesus' last words before ascending to Heaven?\nMark 16:15 — And He said to them, \"Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.\"\nThere are so many Christians today passionate about politics, conspiracies, health, theology, but not many are passionate about Christ's last words.\nWe need to on guard so that we do not become better at winning arguments, than at winning souls. God have mercy on us and forgive us of this great neglect. Give us ears to hear and hearts to receive and obey your word to us.\n2 Timothy 4:2. — Preach the Gospel in season, and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine.

Prices in Maryland are 5.3 cents per gallon higher than a month ago and stand 18.2 cents per gallon higher than a year ago. The national average price of diesel has fallen 1.6 cents in the last week and stands at $3.73 per gallon.According to GasBuddy price reports, the cheapest station in Maryland was priced at $3.05 per gallon yesterday while the most expensive was $4.29 per gallon, a difference of $1.24 per gallon.\nThe national average price of gasoline has risen 1 cent per gallon in the last week, averaging $3.41 per gallon today. The national average is down 18.0 cents per gallon from a month ago and stands 13.8 cents per gallon lower than a year ago, according to GasBuddy data compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports covering over 150,000 gas stations across the country.\nHistorical gasoline prices in Maryland and the national average going back 10 years:\nJune 17, 2023: $3.41 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.55 per gallon)June 17, 2022: $4.97 per gallon (U.S. Average: $4.99 per gallon)June 17, 2021: $2.98 per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.07 per gallon)June 17, 2020: $2.12 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.11 per gallon)June 17, 2019: $2.61 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.67 per gallon)June 17, 2018: $2.85 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.89 per gallon)June 17, 2017: $2.27 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.29 per gallon)June 17, 2016: $2.31 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.35 per gallon)June 17, 2015: $2.77 per gallon (U.S. Average: $2.80 per gallon)June 17, 2014: $3.65per gallon (U.S. Average: $3.67 per gallon)\nNeighboring areas and their current gas prices:\nBaltimore: $3.61 per gallon, up 10.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.51 per gallon.Washington, D.C.: $3.56 per gallon, down 12.4 cents per gallon from last week's $3.68 per gallon.Hagerstown: 3.36 per gallon, down 8.9 cents per gallon from last week's $3.45 per gallon.\n\"Since the national average price of gasoline fell to its lowest June level since 2021 last week, we've seen the drop in prices take a break, with some states seeing a small rise over the last week. Thankfully, I expect this to be more like a short timeout, with an eventual return to falling gasoline prices in most states,\" said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. \"The decline in diesel prices continues, with the national average price of diesel now at its lowest level since January 2022. Both gasoline and diesel prices remain below their year-ago level, which is music to the ears of the Federal Reserve, as fuel prices are a significant component of the Consumer Price Index. Also factoring in gasoline demand that has been running a bit weaker than expected, market fundamentals look pretty good right now if you're a motorist.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Dogs ruled on Sunday October 8, when over 50 were blessed at Christ Church.They strained at their leashes, sniffed around and got in line with their owners to see Rector Steve Mosher, who dressed in a white robe for outside ceremony.A reading from Genesis made God's creative powers known.Mosher read, \"Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky God blessed them and said 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let birds multiply on Earth.'\" He continued to read that God created the creeping things and saw that it was good.There was a reading from Andrew Carter that mentioned a menagerie of animals. There were badgers and hedgehogs, porcupines and penguins, godwits and chuckawallas.Mosher seemed to delight in the word play, and the crowd smiled along too.Then, participants lined up with their Tibetan terriers, golden retrievers and German shepherds.

    "content": "Art exhibit in Easton uses small items to explore larger themes such as war, homelessness\n\n September 4, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 416\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A new art exhibit in Easton uses small-scale items like twigs to tell large-scale stories involving war, poverty and conflict.Inside the Academy Art Museum, \"To the Edge of Your World\" by Dutch-Irish artist Anita Groener welcomes viewers into a peaceful setting of grid-like drawings and bird-chirping sounds.\nTwo main displays — Cradle and Shrapnel — are sculpture works by Groener. They include materials like twigs gathered from walks with her dog that she started collecting more than 10 years ago.\nGroener hopes the sculptures help people understand some of \"their own baggage\" and history.\n\"Everything's very small, which creates a psychological distance,\" said Groener, who lives in Dublin, while inside the Easton exhibit space last month. \"And that's important because we witness all these world events.\"\nFor her, the exhibit is largely motivated by time she spent in the southern United States visiting civil rights monuments, as well as Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nIts meaning continues to evolve today, Groener said.\n\"Like we in Ireland watch what's going on in America,\" she said. \"But it's such a distance, and I'm not taking part in that. Yet it affects us all. Everything that happens in the world, in our lives, affects us and is connected.\"\nThe Ireland-based artist doesn't want people to walk in thinking the art will yield certain takeaways. Rather, Groener hopes her art is open to interpretation.\n\"I like ambiguous readings, because as an artist, you can't be prescriptive,\" she said.\nGroener's exhibit is the Academy Art Museum's first ever international exhibit. Charlotte Potter Kasic, the museum's executive director, said it took \"many hoops to jump through\" to make happen, but she's happy it panned out.\nThe opening weekend for the exhibit and a sister documentary film last month drew more than 250 people, Kasic said. They watched \"Shelter,\" a 30-minute short film addressing homelessness on the Mid-Shore. Groener, the Talbot Interfaith Shelter and filmmaker Matt Kresling collaborated on the project.\nAt the front of Groener's exhibit is the main shelter structure, which is shown at the end of the film. She took around 10,000 pictures of the structure to make the stop-motion scene possible.\nGroener said the scene is a \"coming together of people\" and all about community. Kasic said the audience on opening weekend was captivated by the film.\n\"No one moved,\" Kasic said. \"They were all very engaged.\"\nThe film is slated to show at the Chesapeake Film Festival on Oct. 10 at the Ebenezer Theater in Easton. Groener's exhibit is open at the Academy Art Museum through Oct. 27. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I got interested in politics when I was involved with Medical Freedom for Talbot County.\n1. Why are you running for the Ward 2 seat on the Easton Town Council?\nRunning for Ward 2 is an honor. I am running because we need a voice for the day-to-day people who live in Easton. The hardworking backbone of our society. Your neighbors, servers, police, grocery store workers, those struggling on social security, etc. I see and hear the struggles.\n2. What issues will you prioritize if elected?\nI will prioritize the accountability of the Town Council, transparency and accountability with \"your\" money, smart growth for our special town.\nWe need to keep our next generation. People with and without children are from moving away from the Shore because they can't afford to live here and raise a family.\n3. What changes would you make to the town's budget, and what budget items should not be cut?\nThe town budget is not transparent enough. We need to see more details instead of just line items with no explanations. It's hard to see exactly where our money is going.\n4. While the town has grown, affordable housing remains a challenge for residents. How should the town build more housing, in particular affordable housing?\nIt is funny the Census has Easton population growth of only 101 more people since 2020. We all can see there has been much more growth. Either that or are we just congested because of workers commuting who live in more affordable towns.We need starter home neighborhoods for the first responders, teachers and people not making six figures. We can think outside the box — barndominiums, tiny homes or prefab housing neighborhoods, which are much less expensive to build.\n5. What are your plans for public safety in Easton? What can be improved?\nSafety is key for everyone in Easton. We need to treat our neighbors with kindness. Introduce yourself and watch out for each other. We have exceptional first responders, including police, EMS and volunteer firefighters, working a tough job just out of their heart for the people of their community. They are doing a great job even though they are running with short manpower.\nWith the area growing, we need to make sure we keep them equipped with proper needs.\n6. In addition to serving the Town of Easton as a whole, what are your plans to improve your ward specifically?\nI love the Ward 2 area where I live and volunteer. The Rails to Trails is a huge part of linking neighborhoods to the downtown area. Keeping that a positive and safe trail is always a concern for everyone.\nAlso, Idlewild Park is the most used park in Easton, so we need to keep it updated for everyone. The play area needs some attention, and why not do a pickleball court, since its popularity has grown 52% since 2019?\nThe Star Democrat questionnaire was sent to all Easton Town Council candidates to allow them to share their perspective on various town issues in their own words. Responses may be edited for length and clarity. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Her passing was peaceful as she was comforted and held by her youngest daughter, Anne.Ruth was born on August 21st, 1928, to Annie Elmira Eckert and Nevin Emanuel Dietrich in Fleetwood, Pennsylvania. Ruth loved and cherished her sister, Agnes Breidegam and her three brothers, Ivan, Ray, and Lloyd Dietrich, who preceded her in death.After graduating from high school, Ruth attended Mansfield State Teacher's College, in Pennsylvania. A devoted student, Ruth, earned a BA in Education, with French as her minor.She completed a graduate degree at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.She was a believer in attaining education and she so enjoyed learning, especially foreign languages.She was fluent in German and French.Ruth was a teacher for several years in New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania.Ruth married the late Hubert Chester Santucci on August 22,1953, in Hershey, Pennsylvania.Upon their move to Easton, Maryland, Ruth continued teaching for several more years at St. Michaels High School. Following the births of her daughters, she focused on raising her children and supporting her husband, Hubert, as he continued his employment as principal of Easton High School, and later as Supervisor of Instruction at the Talbot County School Board.Ruth was a devoted wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She always said she would \"fight tigers for her daughters\". She was a nurturer, a protector, and provided calm council for her family. As her husband's health declined, she was his strength. A quiet sentinel at his casket, gently placing his sleep toboggan on his head, so he wouldn't feel cold. A calm enduring presence following his death to give comfort to all the family who were grieving.Ruth was of the Depression Era. She never asked for much and was content with what she did have. She always put others feelings ahead of her own and it was most important for her to conduct herself in a ladylike manner. She never wanted to cause distress or inconvenience for anyone. A resilient lady, calm in a crisis, always lending emotional support to others.A member of St. Peter and Paul Catholic Church, Ruth had a strong faith. She did not fear death. She was confident she would be surrounded by her loved ones when she passed.Ruth is survived by her daughters, Lisa Santucci Dunphy, Amy Santucci Parrish, and Anne Kay Santucci; granddaughter, Kathryn Taylor Raver and her husband, Adam; grandson, William Chester Parrish, and his wife, Arianne; her great-grandchildren James Hubert Raver and Peyton Louis Raver; her sons-in-law, John Dunphy and Randy Parrish. Ruth will be cremated and her remains will be buried with her cherished husband, Hubert Chester Santucci, at the Eastern Shore Veteran's Cemetery.As Ruth had a love of learning and teaching, in lieu of flowers, she would have appreciated a donation to the Talbot County Free Library of Easton, Maryland. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Glassman interviewed around 20 dancers who, without knowing it, shared common loves, struggles and difficulties.\nGlassman's own career as a dancer ended 30 years ago after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. This prompted his quest to understand why dancers commit their lives to the artform for such a long time.\n\"I decided their answers should be heard by a wider audience, which was the impetus for the interviews,\" Glassman said. \"Their specific answers about their experiences adjusted my perspective beyond my own, bringing in topics relevant to the whole dance community over the years, like the HIV epidemic.\"\n\"Lives Beyond Motion\" is Glassman's first documentary, and he said he's been submitting it to every film festival possible.\nAudience members went around the room describing what about the film resonated with them most. Multiple people spoke of the authenticity and vulnerability of the interviewees, which they said made this film personal and emotional.\nAn Eastern Shore connection\nMatt Kreslings short film follows the journey of 20th century American artist Robert Rauschenberg's trip to China in the 1980s, his creative relationship with long-time Eastern Shore resident Donald Saff and, ultimately, his creation of a long, scroll-like photograph he named \"Chinese Summerfall.\"\nThe 10-minute film explored the painstaking process of printmaking at a time when artists were physically cutting negative images and didn't know if they were done properly until the images were processed.\n\"I want my work to make you care because I care,\" Rauschenberg said in the film.\nThe Academy Art Museum will celebrate Rauschenberg's 100th birthday with the exhibit \"Rauschenberg 100: New Connections\" opening Dec. 11 and running through May 3, 2026.\nThe exhibit will include \"Chinese Summerfall,\" which is rarely exhibited due to its size and fragility, according to the Academy Art Museums website. It will also feature showings of Kresling's short film, \"100 Foot Photo.\"\n\"Receiving the support that we do from the community, from our sponsors, our partners, our patrons, makes such a huge difference for us,\" Walker said. \"We simply couldn't do it without you.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

From lawyers, to entrepreneurs, to nurses, to educators, a wide swath of the Mid-Shore was represented at this APG Chesapeake event.The women honored at the event were selected through community nominations, with criteria like community service, professional accomplishment and personal achievement being considered. More than 200 women from the Mid-Shore region were nominated.\n\"I think it highlights all the work that everybody in the community does and just how powerful our community of women are,\" said nominee Kari Mielke Clow, principal at Chapel District Elementary.\nOf the nominees, 16 women were selected by the Women to Watch committee to be featured in this year's Women to Watch magazine, which profiles impactful work being done by women in the Mid-Shore community.\nThere were three featured speakers at the event — Ivette Furneisen, lawyer; Sharon Pepukayi, superintendent of Talbot County Public Schools; and Meisha Amia, nurse, author and entrepreneur.\nFurneisen is from Barcelona. She used her native language, Spanish, to help the Hispanic immigrant community navigate the legal system. Being from Spain, she too had to wrestle with visas, employment authorization and becoming a resident, she said. Already a lawyer in Spain when she moved to the U.S., she had to go to law school a second time to practice as a lawyer in Maryland.\n\"During COVID I had this clever idea, with a 6-month-old at my house, to go back to law school,\" she said. \"So I did it. I have been able to help a lot of people.\"\nFurneisen recently opened her law practice, Campbell and Furneisen Law Firm, in Chestertown.\nIn closing she said, \"It is on all of us to make sure the next generation of women are as strong as we are.\"\nPepukayi, who spoke after Furneisen, talked about what motivated her on her path to her position to superintendent.\nShe said she learned from the courage, confidence and communication skills of strong women who surrounded her.\n\"The courage for me to take risks, to fail forward, to laugh at my mistakes, to dust myself off and get back up when I got knocked down, to apply for jobs that I knew I would have to work really, really hard for,\" she said.\n\"The confidence to share my far-fetched ideas, to walk into a room where I was the only person that looked like me, but to know I could contribute and make a difference,\" Pepukayi continued. \"And being communicative to share my vulnerable stories, to be transparent even when it is not good news and to meet and mentor other young women… to seek to understand rather than to be understood.\"\nShe extolled the audience to help each other and to not let jealousy get in the way. She asked them to mentor younger women as they had been mentored.\nThe final speaker was Amia, a writer, labor and delivery nurse, and entrepreneur.\nAs a travel nurse with over 40 assignments, \"I treated my road trips like a 90-day evaluations on the job. I am getting things done, and I am like, 'Girl you have got to grow,'\" Amia said.\n\"The most important thing I am going to tell you today is do not be afraid to wander. Just because your path is different, it doesn't mean that you are lost. Your path is preparing you for purpose.\"\nThere were many sponsors of the event, including Easton Economic Development, Easton Utilities, Pohanka Automotive Group, Wye Financial Partners, Queenstown Landing, Shore Legal Access, Parker Counts, The Ivy, All in the Mix Bakeshop and Ruby's.\nAPG Chesapeake made a $5,000 donation to Foundation of Hope, a nonprofit organization providing cultural, spiritual, social and educational trainings to girls in middle school through an after-school program aimed at helping girls to become leaders.\n\"The event really came together early this year — we sold out a week prior,\" said Betsy Griffin, assistant regional manager for sales at APG Chesapeake. \"The speakers were fascinating and each offered snappy pieces of solid advice. How fun to watch the nominee's stand with a cheering section behind them during the event.\n\"Next year we hope to incorporate a level of mentoring for young people and are so appreciative of Foundation of Hope, as they do this type of important work,\" Griffin continued. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Douglass knew it was sometime in February but not the exact day.\nDouglass chose to celebrate on Valentine's Day because his mother called him her \"little Valentine.\"\n\"Yes, he celebrated his birthday on Valentine's Day,\" Douglass' five-time great nephew Tarence Bailey Sr. said. \"Feb. 14 through Feb. 20, you can say it's the most important week of Black History Month because that's the week of Frederick Douglass' birth and death.\"\nDouglass has strong roots in Talbot County and throughout the Eastern Shore.\nBorn in Talbot County in 1818, Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey Douglass was enslaved for 20 years in Baltimore and on Talbot County farms. He fled north in 1838 and changed his name to Frederick Douglass. His brilliance, eloquence and courage, quickly brought him to the forefront of the abolitionist movement.\nHe was known for his skills as an orator, with many of his speeches remembered to this day.\n\"He spoke in Denton on Halloween 1883, and Douglas took the train from Wilmington to Denton,\" author and historian John Muller said. \"Then when he was leaving and he spoke in front of the County Courthouse in Denton... there was so many people they didn't fit inside. The crowd had to go outside.\"\nAccording to Muller, Douglass also spoke in Cambridge, St. Michaels, and many more Eastern Shore locales.\nDouglass and his work are inspirational to many Americans, but it goes deeper than just inspiration for the Bailey-Groce Family Foundation, Bailey said.\nThe Bailey-Groce Family Foundation is run by multiple Douglass family members who grew up on the Eastern Shore. It is one of two family foundations operated by descendants of the Douglass bloodline.\n\"I think for my family here from Talbot County and from Eastern Shore as a whole, it's a whole lot different for us,\" Bailey said. \"Being raised on the Shore and then having the relative like him, you look at it differently than the average person does.\"\nThree years ago, the foundation started hosting a birthday celebration for Fredrick Douglas between Feb. 14 and 20, close to his birthday and the anniversary of his death. This year's celebration will be held on Feb. 22 due to a scheduling conflict.\nThe birthday celebration is held to help fundraise for an African American Cultural Center and an African American Historical Society, institutions the foundation plans to establish in Talbot County.\nThe event will begin at the historic Avalon Theatre at 3:45 p.m.\nThis year's event will feature a homecoming performance by Ayla Dennis, who was featured on American Idol.\n\"She's actually a Bailey family descendant,\" Bailey said. \"So it's going to be a history making to have her singing at the Avalon, which was a formerly segregated theater down the street from where the slave auction once was, right there by the courthouse where Frederick Douglass spoke, having his relatives actually headlining for his birthday in a formerly segregated theater.\"\nOther entertainment for Douglass' birthday celebration includes a county group from Atlanta, Georgia; a concert violinist from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; a featured poet from Brooklyn, New York; and many more.\nAfter the performances, the foundation will host a VIP dinner at the Waterfowl Building in Easton. The foundation wants everyone to wear African-style clothing to honor Douglass' heritage.\n\"Frederick Douglass was a very classy dude. We like to keep his birthday the way he would want it,\" Bailey said. \"He was John Q when it came to his clothes. Everything he wore was Brooks Brothers. So he was always dressed to the nines. So I know that at his birthday party, he would want everybody in there dressed as well as him.\"\nThe Foundation continues to host these types of events not just to raise funds, but to keep Douglass' legacy alive, Bailey said.\n\"Uncle Frederick is the main reason, the only reason that I that keeps me going, that keeps me pushing,\" Bailey Sr. said. \"The goal is much bigger, Fredrick Douglass himself is the inspiration, because if it wasn't for him I don't know if we would have made it this far.\"\nFor more information about the celebration or to purchase tickets, visit avalonfoundation.org/events. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Maryland approves $2.75 million settlement for discrimination by state police\n\n October 2, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MARISSA YELENIK Capital News Service | Section: State News \n \n 548\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Top state officials approved a $2.75 million settlement on Wednesday after a federal investigation turned up evidence of discriminatory hiring practices by the Maryland State Police.The U.S. Department of Justice conducted a two-year investigation into state police hiring practices for a violation of Title VII, which prohibits discrimination against employees or applicants based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.\nThe investigation found that the state police engaged in discriminatory practices against Black and female applicants, agency officials acknowledged in a meeting of the Maryland Board of Public Works on Wednesday.\nThe DOJ said that MDSP written tests disproportionately impacted Black candidates, while their physical fitness tests disproportionately impacted female candidates. The tests discriminated against candidates while failing to \"meaningfully distinguish between applicants who can and cannot perform the position of Trooper,\" according to a Department of Justice press release.\n\"Discrimination in any form has no place within the Maryland State Police, and it will not be tolerated,\" Col. Roland Butler Jr., superintendent of MDSP, told the board Wednesday. \"We're committed to making meaningful and lasting change … [and] to develop new policies and procedures that ensure equitable treatment for all applicants.\"\nThe board — made up of Gov. Wes Moore, state Comptroller Brooke Lierman and Treasurer Dereck E. Davis — signed off on the settlement. The agreement must also be approved by a federal court before moving forward.\nIn response to the investigation, MDSP will change its current testing methods to prevent future discrimination in hiring, but the new practices will not be ready until after the next two MDSP classes start, Butler said. To adapt, he said, MDSP intends to change existing standards, including eliminating time requirements from different portions of the physical fitness tests.\nMembers of the Board of Public Works raised concerns about this interim period, with Davis questioning whether the unclear guidelines would lead to more discrimination.\n\"Now it becomes subjective, so doesn't that lend itself, potentially, to be more discriminatory?\" Davis asked. \"Now we don't know what's good or what's not as it relates to that time.\"\nButler assured Davis that strict monitoring of who passes and fails the tests would be in place, allowing MDSP to monitor areas of improvement.\n\"We won't have the other test in place at this time,\" Butler said. \"However, we're relaxing the standards that we have … We will be allowed to use those tests under the condition that we provide strict monitoring to see what the results are, to see who's passing, who's failing and we do think that we'll get a larger pool of applicants when we start to look at how we measure that test and how we evaluate it.\"\nOfficials said the new tests would emphasize fairness while maintaining safety requirements, including a test that would receive ongoing validation to guarantee it was modern, fair and relevant, as well as an aptitude test to look for integrity, self-motivation, critical thinking and judgment skills.\nThe settlement involved 48 Black and female individuals who were prevented from becoming state troopers due to the discriminatory practices, according to Butler.\nSince his appointment in 2023, Butler said, he has worked to evaluate and modernize the agency's practices.\n\"I remain steadfastly committed to cultivating a culture that will ensure inclusiveness,\" Butler said, \"one that allows the fulfillment of our mission, of values centered around integrity, fairness, and service.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Medical center, juvenile justice top priorities for Shore lawmakers\n\n November 10, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 883\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Securing funding for the new regional medical center and addressing local impacts of last year's juvenile justice reform laws are priorities for Mid-Shore lawmakers heading into the 2024 General Assembly in January.During a Tuesday meeting with the Talbot County Council and local stakeholders, the three Mid-Shore legislators, Sen. Johnny Mautz and Reps. Chris Adams and Tom Hutchinson, tackled a number of issues affecting the district, discussing ways to advance their progress in the upcoming legislative session.REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTERSecuring financial support for the University of Maryland Shore Regional Health's new regional medical center has long been a top priority for local legislators.The proposed 147-bed hospital and medical office building are slated to occupy just over 235 acres off of Longwoods Road near U.S.Route 50 in Easton.The start of construction is dependent on the project receiving a Certificate of Need from the Maryland Health Care Commission.The hospital system filed the CON application in January and anticipates a response in December or January, said Ken Kozel, president and CEO of UM Shore Regional Health.In a separate process, the hospital system is working with the Health Services Cost Review Commission, the state's rate-setting authority, to see if rate relief can be obtained to offset the cost of interest and depreciation for the project.However, MHCC will first need to hear from HSCRC to determine if the project is financially viable before making a decision on the application. Uncertainty lies in how much the HSCRC decision will weigh on the health care commission's answer, Kozel said.That relief, along with government funding, is key to moving forward with the regional medical center.Former Gov. Larry Hogan earmarked $100 million last December for the project in the state's fiscal year 2024 budget.During this year's legislative session, lawmakers secured $10 million in the budget for the new medical center, which the hospital system must spend by June 30, 2024, Kozel said.There's also a pledge for $20 million in fiscal year 2025, though it's subject to change, so the hospital system is asking Gov. Wes Moore to solidify that allocation, along with the remaining $70 million, he added.The county council and lawmakers can write letters of support to help ensure the governor is aware of the project, Kozel said.Del. Chris Adams (R-37B) expressed his vote of confidence and support.\"We want this project to happen as much as you do and as much as every elected official does,\" he said, \"And most importantly, as much as every citizen that will stand to benefit from the delivery of the services that are possible in a brand new facility and the quality that you get from your organization.\"JUVENILE JUSTICETalbot County Sheriff's Office Capt. John Bollinger and Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey raised concerns about the significant impacts resulting from the passage of juvenile justice reform measures last year.Bollinger said the legislature was \"wrong\" for passing the laws last year, highlighting a 42% increase in youth crime in schools and two provisions of the laws that have been particularly burdensome for local law enforcement.One provision bars police from being able to charge a child under 13 years old with a crime unless it's a violent crime, such as murder, attempted murder or rape.\"The worst part is that these kids know that, and the criminals know that,\" Bollinger said, suggesting that 12-year-olds could be implicated in illegal activities and not be punished for their involvement.\"They can do it in front of our face, and we can't do anything other than tell them, 'That's bad, you shouldn't do that,'\" he said.Under another law, police are not allowed to interview a child after they're arrested until the child has an attorney to represent them, even if it's to get more information or to find out if others are involved.\"I'm here to tell you that there's not a lawyer anywhere that's going to say, 'Sure, tell the police everything,' - they're going to shut them down on the phone without even meeting them, knowing nothing about the case, and then our hands are tied,\" Bollinger said.The increase in crime in schools is mainly from the county's middle and high schools, and the majority of the crimes are assaults, he said. And out of 114 reported assaults in the schools in the last year, 40 of them involved children under 13.However, Talbot County is experiencing less youth crime than some other Shore jurisdictions. In Dorchester and Wicomico counties, the number of assaults on both students and staff are \"dramatically higher\" than previous years, said Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-37B).\"The good newsis every county is now talking about it,\" he said. \"The county executives on the western shore are talking about it, butis anybody going to want to make a change?\"COUNTY INITIATIVESWhile there are no specific Talbot County bills being proposed for consideration by the state legislature so far, the county is supporting the Maryland Association of Counties' 2024 legislative initiatives.Those initiatives include launching forward-thinking firefighter and emergency medical services incentives, providing transparency in education spending, modernizing local revenue structures and advancing comprehensive housing solutions. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nUniversity of Maryland Shore Regional Health President and CEO Ken Kozel speaks to Talbot County Council members and state legislators on funding for the new regional medical center in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed adds makeup day for snow; approves 2025-26 calendar\n\n January 17, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 580\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — During Wednesday's meeting, the Talbot County Board of Education added a day onto the end of this year's school calendar following last week's snowstorm.Talbot County Public Schools was closed Monday through Friday last week due to snow that blanketed the Mid-Shore. However, the 2024-2025 school calendar only had four inclement weather days built in, meaning an additional day was needed to comply with the state's 180-day requirement.\nHelga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, recommended that a day be added in June, moving the last day of school for students to Friday, June 13.\nThe last day for teachers would be Monday, June 16. Einhorn said that historically, most teachers complete mandated training that affords them with not having to come in on the last day.\nThe board unanimously passed the adjusted calendar for this year.\n2025-26 CALENDAROn Wednesday, the board also chose the district's calendar for the 2025-2026 school year.\nAt last month's meeting, Einhorn presented a draft calendar with two days off in March and a five-day spring break, which was the recommendation of the calendar committee. Board President Emily Jackson, however, expressed frustration there weren't multiple options posed.\nThis month, Einhorn returned with three draft calendars. The first was similar to what the board saw in December, with a four-day weekend in March and the shorter spring break. The second draft removed the off days in March and had an eight-day spring break.\nA third draft included both the March break and an eight-day spring break, pushing the last student day back to June 10, 2026.\nAll three drafts included the typical days off in November for Easton's Waterfowl Festival, as well as a winter break from Dec. 20, 2025, to Jan. 4, 2026.\n\"There is no calendar that we're going to create that is best for every single person,\" Jackson said.\nJackson said it's clear — based on previous polling and community input — that most families favor the extended spring break. Board Vice President Amy Dodson suggested the board move forward with the second or third calendars.\nBoard member Karla Wieland-Cherry said she preferred the first calendar with the shorter spring break.\n\"You're losing a lot of school time for eight days off for students,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"You're losing a lot of momentum. And plus you're concerned with providing day care. Not all employers are going to allow that. That's quite a long time to take off of work and find day care and so forth.\"\nShe added that not all families are looking for a longer spring break.\n\"My only concern is that if 59% of our students are at the poverty level, we're really talking about more of a smaller group who are really going to financially be able to afford an Easter holiday,\" Wieland-Cherry said. \"… You really could possibly potentially be causing more hardship for something that's more an elitist type thing, quite honestly.\"\nJackson said while she agrees with Wieland-Cherry's point, she has \"to go with what the community is saying.\"\n\"We have asked again and again, and the majority of the respondents to any time we've asked this have said they like that spring break,\" Jackson said.\nFollowing board discussion, Jackson motioned for approval of the third calendar featuring two off days in March and five days for spring break. Her motion included an amendment to the calendar that the March days off serve as two of four inclement weather days for the district.\nBy a 6-1 vote, with only Wieland-Cherry voting against, the board approved the 2025-2026 school year calendar. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

South was not happy rebidding two no-trump, but he knew his partner did not have four hearts (no negative double over one spade), and five clubs was a long way away. North raised because he had a fifth club and a vulnerable game bonus was very tempting.South saw six top tricks: three hearts, one diamond and two clubs. If clubs were 2-1, there were nine easy winners. So, declarer assumed they were 3-0. Who had the tripleton? Surely it was East because West already seemed to be marked with at least nine pointedsuit cards. However, before immediately playing a club to dummy's king, he silently said to himself, \"Wait, wait.\" He could acquire more data by first cashing his heart winners.Well, well - West had only one heart. If he had been void in clubs, he would have had something like 6=1=6=0 distribution and surely would have bid three or four diamonds over two no-trump.South cashed his club ace and claimed when East discarded.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Baltimore will pay two installments of $1,662,150 on Sept. 15 and 30, according to trade details obtained by The Associated Press. The money reduces San Diego's expense to $482,151, which comes to a prorated share of the $760,000 minimum for each.\nBaltimore will send Detroit $2,758,065 on Sept. 30 as part of the trade that sent right-hander Charlie Morton to the Tigers for minor league left-hander Micah Ashman. Morton was owed $4,758,064 of his $15 million salary, and the cash reduces his cost to the Tigers to $2 million. In addition, the Orioles will send the Tigers $100,000 on Aug. 15 as part of the trade to acquire left-hander Dietrich Enns.\nThe Orioles also are sending Toronto $1.75 million on Sept. 30 as part of the July 29 trade that sent right-hander Seranthony Domínguez to the Blue Jays for minor league right-hander Juaron Watts-Brown — a deal announced between games of a doubleheader between the teams. Domínguez had $2,645,161 left from his $8 million salary at the time of the trade.\nBaltimore is giving Houston $520,000 along with infielder Ramón Urías, who was dealt for minor leaguer right-hander Twine Palmer. The money is due in equal payments on Sept. 15 and Oct. 15. Urías was owed $1,016,129 of his $3.15 million salary.\nMoney in the five trades totals $8,452,365. Baltimore opened the season with a $169 million payroll, 15th among the 30 major league teams.\nMinnesota is paying $33 million to Houston in the July 31 trade that returned All-Star Carlos Correa to the Astros for minor league left-hander Matt Mikulski, by far the largest amount among 14 deadline trades involving cash transactions. That covered a significant portion of the $103,419,355 remaining in the contract of the three-time All-Star, who left the Astros to sign with the Twins ahead of the 2022 season. Houston gets $3 million this year and $10 million each in 2026, 2027 and 2028, with installments due each Dec. 15.\nArizona will pay Milwaukee $5,258,000 as part of the July 31 trade that sent right-hander Shelby Miller and left-hander Jordan Montgomery to the Brewers for a player to be named or cash. Arizona will send the money in four installments of $1,314,500 on Aug. 15, Aug. 31, Sept. 15 and Sept. 30. Montgomery was owed $7,137,097 of his $22.5 million salary and Miller $317,204 of his $1 million salary.\nMilwaukee is sending San Diego $2,169,000 as part of the trade that sent left-hander Nestor Cortes and minor league infielder Jorge Quintana to the Padres for outfielder Brandon Lockridge. That offsets part of the $2,410,753 remaining from Cortes' $7.6 million salary. The Brewers will send $361,500 each on Aug. 15 and 29, Sept. 12 and 26 plus $723,000 on Oct. 10.\nCincinnati is paying Pittsburgh $1,935,484 as part of the July 30 trade that sent left-hander Taylor Rogers and minor league shortstop Sammy Stafura to the Pirates for third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes. The cash covers half the $3,870,968 Rogers was owed from his $12 million salary, and the Reds paid $435,484 on Aug. 1 and owe $500,000 each on Aug. 15, Sept. 1 and Sept. 15.\nRogers was dealt the following day to the Cubs for outfielder Ivan Brethowr, and Pittsburgh agreed to give the Cubs $1,903,226. That offset half the $3,806,452 then left on Rogers' salary after the $64,516 he earned during his one day with Pittsburgh, for whom he never threw a pitch. The Pirates pay $423,226 on Aug . 15 and owe $500,000 installments on Aug. 31, Sept. 15 and Sept. 30.\nSan Francisco will give Kansas City $1,934,100 as part of the trade that sent outfielder Mike Yastzemski to the Royals for right-hander Yunior Marte. Yastzemski was owed $2,934,140 of his $9.25 million salary, and the Giants will make four payments of $483,535 on Aug. 15. Aug. 31, Sept. 15 and Sept. 30.\nTampa Bay is sending Milwaukee $1.1 million in the July 28 trade that sent catcher Danny Jansen to his hometown Brewers for minor league infielder Jadher Areinamo. Jansen was owed $2,833,333 of his $8.5 million salary. The Rays will make six payments of $183,333, on Aug. 1, 15 and 29, Sept. 12 and 26, and Oct. 10. Tampa Bay agreed to send an additional $500,000 if a $12 million mutual option for 2026 is declined, which carries a $500,000 buyout.\nSt. Louis agreed to pay Atlanta $2.28 million as part of the July 27 trade that sent right-hander Erick Fedde to the Braves for a player to be named or cash. Fedde was owed $2,455,645 from his $7.25 million salary. The Cardinals will make equal payments of $1.14 million on Aug. 11 and Sept. 22.\nDetroit will pay Texas $100,000 on Aug. 15 as part of the trade to acquire right-hander Codi Heuer. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot County removes DEI statement amid funding concerns for airport\n\n June 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 752\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The Talbot County Council voted Tuesday to remove the diversity, equity and inclusion statement from the county's employee handbook, reversing course from March, when the council upheld the diversity statement.Tuesday's decision came amid concerns for millions of dollars in federal funding for an ongoing Easton Airport project. Those worries stem from an April directive from U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy outlining the Trump administration's view that DEI programs violate federal law.\nCouncil Vice President Pete Lesher and council member Dave Stepp sponsored Tuesday's resolution, which passed 4-1 with council member Keasha Haythe opposing. Haythe, Lesher and council member Lynn Mielke had voted down Stepp's attempt to remove the DEI statement in March.\nLesher, a Democrat, said it was a difficult decision, noting he changed his tune on the measure due to a \"vindictive and maleficent federal administration.\"\n\"The risk is that some incompetent political appointee will read only the title of our statement, misconstrue it as an illegal policy and deny a federal grant on that basis,\" Lesher said. \"In an event like that, even if we win on appeal, it could leave us in a state of construction limbo for an unacceptably long time.\"\nLesher added, \"We simply need to ensure that we are using none of the language that could trigger some snowflake in Washington.\"\nMielke, a Republican, said she agreed with Lesher and that Talbot County has always been a merit-based employer.\nStepp, a Republican, said council members \"fell short\" and put the county in a vulnerable spot when they rejected his original proposal in March.\n\"It's very frustrating that we even need to be discussing this here today. It should've been dealt with months ago,\" Stepp said. \"This matter has been highly politicized and turned into something it is not.\"\n\"Today's action is fiscal in nature,\" he added.\nCouncil President Chuck Callahan, a Republican, voted to remove the statement in March and did so again Tuesday. He said the controversial topic — which garnered strong resident opposition and led to two heated meetings — has been \"tough on council.\"\n\"I know we all have our own beliefs, one way or the other with the DEI stuff,\" Callahan said. \"But at this time I think we've made the right decision and the right statement.\"\nHaythe, the council's only non-white member and a Democrat, asked county attorney Patrick Thomas about an opinion letter he provided on the DEI statement and Duffy's directive. Duffy's directive to all DOT funding recipients referenced the U.S. Supreme Court's 2023 rejection of affirmative action programs at Harvard University.\n\"I do not believe that the statement is discriminatory, and I do not believe that the Supreme Court (case) being referenced in the secretary of transportation letter applies to that statement,\" Thomas said.\nTuesday's resolution, effectively immediately, voids Talbot County's DEI statement. Two 2020 diversity resolutions are also \"of no further force and effect,\" according to the newly approved resolution.\nThose resolutions had facilitated the creation of the diversity statement and required the county manager to provide an annual diversity training report to the council, respectively.\nThe new resolution states nothing in it \"shall be construed as a repudiation of the intent and desire\" of the county to ensure a \"welcoming workplace\" in which employees are treated fairly based on race, sex, national origin, etc.\nLesher asked county staff to work on a \"replacement welcoming statement\" for the county's employee handbook.\nAIRPORT PROJECT\nEaston Airport's ongoing modernization project — which will relocate and expand the airport's main runway — is 90% funded by the Federal Aviation Administration, an organization within the Department of Transportation. The airport is owned and operated by Talbot County.\nAirport Manager Micah Risher said he consulted with county staff after the April DOT letter. In an interview Tuesday, Risher said he has \"absolute faith\" in the council's support of the airport. Risher added that the airport ensures it is always abiding by federal and state laws.\n\"To have Easton Airport have any sort of funding at jeopardy, it's a bigger deal than the average person may think,\" Risher said, citing the airport's large economic impact on the community.\nAccording to Risher, the airport received around $17 million from the FAA for the first two phases of the project. Estimates on the remaining federal funding for the rest of the project aren't available since bids are out, he said, but over $30 million of work remains.\n\"We're up here against our greatest milestone that is really going to ensure that we have a viable airport, and this great economic engine, succeed here in Talbot County for another 80-plus years,\" he said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton election cycle has been charged, political in nature\n\n May 3, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 869\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Easton saw a heated election the last time the council president seat was up for grabs. This year's race is no different.Since campaigns for the three open Town Council seats began this winter, there have been stolen and vandalized campaign signs, tense debates on campaign finance transparency and, most recently, political mailers from Republican-endorsed candidates calling out Mayor Megan Cook.\nThe tenor of the election cycle — which culminates with voting Tuesday — is largely influenced by the race for Town Council president between incumbent Frank Gunsallus and current Ward 2 representative Don Abbatiello.\nAt a town hall Tuesday, both candidates offered thoughts on civility.\n\"In the past two years, the council members overall, have been almost always conducting themselves in a civil manner,\" said Gunsallus. \"There are times where debate may get heated. That is the nature of democracy.\"\n\"Arguing is fine, I get it. Disagreements occur,\" Abbatiello said. \"But it needs to be done in a respectful manner.\"\nWard 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry, who has endorsed Abbatiello, said the charged nature of this election isn't normal for Easton. And it's hurting the town, she says.\n\"Anytime you create an environment based on animosity, it becomes counterproductive, fairly quickly,\" Curry said. \"And I think that's sort of where we are today.\"\nTalbot County Republican Central Committee vice chair Shari Wilcoxon believes a reason the race is so intense is that it's a fight to preserve Easton's charm.\n\"People love our little town. It's a jewel,\" she said. \"And we had a lot of people move here during COVID because they wanted to get out of the crud to come to this little town. A lot of us want to preserve that.\"\nENDORSEMENTS\nAs Gunsallus and Abbatiello square off, they have racked up endorsements from local politicians and even fellow council members.\nAbbatiello received endorsements from Curry and, in a surprise to some, Ward 3's David Montgomery, who had sided with Gunsallus on several contentious matters discussed by the council in the past year.\n\"It would be very hard for us to move forward productively for the next four years under that kind of leadership,\" Montgomery said of Gunsallus.\nCurry says Abbatiello's experience and knowledge make him the best candidate. \"He has the right temperament,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Gunsallus' main endorsements come from Republican leaders — the Republican Central Committee, Sheriff Joe Gamble, Sen. Johnny Mautz and Dels. Chris Adams and Tom Hutchinson.\nWilcoxon said the committee looked at values — not necessarily party affiliation — when endorsing Gunsallus and mother-and-son newcomers Lynn and Cameron Keefe, who are running in Wards 2 and 4, respectively.\n\"To me he's a phenomenal leader,\" Wilcoxon said of Gunsallus, citing his thoughtfulness and transparency.\n\"He's not afraid to ask questions,\" Mautz said. \" ... Sometimes, the questions may seem silly. And other times, they may reveal things that most people aren't aware of.\"\nAbbatiello and his supporters have denounced the involvement of political parties in the town's election, which is nonpartisan and doesn't list candidates alongside a party.\n\"I do not think that the Republican Party platform has anything to do with the issues that we face here in Easton, and so I don't understand why the party has decided to intervene so strongly in a local election,\" Montgomery, a Republican, said.\nMautz said while the election is performed as nonpartisan, it is political in nature. \"Every election has got politics baked into it,\" he said.\n\"I think that everybody fools themselves if they say it's nonpartisan,\" Wilcoxon said. \"Everybody knows. Everybody knows everybody's party. We can just cut the pretending, right?\"\nFlavio Hickel, an associate professor of political science at Washington College, sees both sides of the argument.\n\"Broadly speaking, I don't think it's a good idea to allow for local party endorsements or to make nonpartisan elections partisan, because you are allowing partisanship to interfere in local town government,\" Hickel said.\nHowever, Hickel said knowing which parties candidates align with is informative for voters, especially at a local level.\n\"Most voters probably aren't familiar with the candidates running,\" he said. \" ... What party identity does at all levels of elections is it provides a very quick information shortcut for voters.\"\nCurry and Montgomery's endorsements have raised questions, too.\nWilcoxon said she views Montgomery's opposition to Gunsallus as personal and said she believes Montgomery and Cook's sponsorship of a campaign finance ordinance was \"100%\" an attack on Gunsallus' campaign.\nAt the town hall Tuesday, Gunsallus spoke of council endorsements: \"I would not want an endorsement from a fellow council member because I believe that that is out of bounds,\" he said. Then he made a remark seemingly concerning Montgomery.\n\"And especially one of them, I would not accept it.\"\nMontgomery disputed that claim, telling The Star Democrat Friday that Gunsallus asked for his endorsement a few months ago, but that he declined.\nCurry said she hadn't before made an endorsement as a sitting council member, but that she gave a \"great deal of thought\" in endorsing Abbatiello.\nIn her eyes, the discourse around endorsements and political sides are making the campaign heated, instead of what she'd rather the election be centered on: issues such as growth and housing.\n\"There's too much of the 'he said,' 'he said,' and he's backed by this guy and he's backed by this guy,\" Curry said. \"The issues have taken a back seat, and that's wrong.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bernice Mireku North (D-Montgomery), the bill's sponsor, and other advocates say the proposed legislation comes in response to a Supreme Court decision last June that ruled it was not cruel and unusual punishment for local governments to civilly and criminally penalize homeless people for setting up encampments on public land.\nMireku-North wrote in a statement to The Star Democrat that the proposed bill has \"brought to light the heart-led efforts\" of local governments to support unhoused individuals. An emphasis of the bill is to prevent immediate arrests, she said.\n\"At a minimum, we are asking law enforcement to prioritize inquiring whether an alternative indoor space exists for unhoused people engaging in life-sustaining activities before resorting to arrest,\" Mireku-North wrote.\nThe delegate said legislators are \"committed\" to working with local officials and stakeholders on the bill.\nAllie Post, director of development and communications for The Women's Law Center of Maryland, said the bill would be a measure in which the state \"(stands) up for folks proactively\" following the June Supreme Court ruling.\n\"Especially for survivors (of domestic violence) and survivors of color, homelessness is often a price of leaving an abuser,\" Post said. \"And folks who have less financial means and less flexibility in those means are really put between a rock and a hard place, and this is an opportunity for Maryland to step up and start taking seriously the homelessness problem that we have.\"\nWhile advocates say it's a needed step forward in the path to address Maryland's homelessness crisis, some Easton and Talbot County officials say the bill is endangering the efforts already being taken.\nTalbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble and the Sheriff's Office released a video on Facebook last month depicting what they believe a potential encounter could look like with a homeless individual if the bill is passed.\n\"If these were to pass, we could have homeless encampments in Idlewild Park, (the) courthouse,\" Gamble said in a separate video the department shared. \" … You literally could set up a tent on the 50-yard-line at Easton High School before an Easton football game and call it your home, and we would not be able to move those people.\"\nGamble said the homelessness issue is serious in Talbot County and that he's not against addressing it. However, he believes the bill as written will strip away authority of locally elected officials.\n\"They will not be able to follow the zoning laws that they've put into place to make downtown Easton the place it is, or downtown St. Michaels or downtown Oxford to be those nice places that people want to come to visit and spend their hard-earned money,\" Gamble said in an interview. \"They will have absolutely no control over it.\"\nEaston Mayor Megan Cook addressed the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee in a Feb. 5 letter opposing the bill.\nCook wrote that the bill \"would supersede local ordinance and policies that have been carefully crafted to address the needs of both unhoused individuals and the broader community.\"\n\"By prohibiting local and state officials from enforcing reasonable regulations on the use of public spaces, the bill could lead to unintended consequences that compromise public safety, hinder economic development, and create significant enforcement challenges,\" Cook wrote.\nIn her letter, Cook asked legislators to instead focus on policies that would provide funding for housing assistance, mental health and job programs.\n\"Our community is committed to addressing homelessness with dignity and care—through outreach, support services, and housing initiatives—while also ensuring that public spaces remain accessible and safe for all,\" Cook wrote. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

His efforts to celebrate the Eastern Shore's people and ecology have helped land him on the shortlist for one of the culinary industry's most prestigious awards.\nThe James Beard Foundation has named Peet as a semifinalist for best chef in the Mid-Atlantic region. Just getting considered is a \"huge deal\" for the team at Bas Rouge, the executive chef said.\n\"I have never pursued it because I was so intimidated by it. But then I built this amazing team, and Mr. (Paul) Prager, the owner, helped me build this amazing team and put this amazing restaurant together,\" Peet said. \"... Then we started getting the influx. Going for the James Beard built a lot of confidence in myself and in my team.\"\nEstablished in 1990 and first awarded in 1991, the James Beard Foundation's Restaurant and Chef Awards recognize exceptional talent and achievement in the culinary arts, hospitality, media and broader food system, as well as a demonstrated commitment to racial and gender equity, community, sustainability and a culture where all can thrive, according to the James Beard website.\nNominees for the award will be announced on Wednesday, April 3, and winners will be announced at the James Beard Restaurant and Chef Awards Ceremony on Monday, June 10.\nThe Bas Rouge team draws inspiration from the endless bounty of the Chesapeake to inform its menu, which offers European-style dishes made with local ingredients.\n\"Every year, every turn of the season it absolutely floors me with something that tastes even better,\" Peet said. \"The natural shift of final products that are coming out of the Bay or coming out of the fields in the summer, they continuously always get better. The purveyors, and the growers and the foragers that we deal with are constantly trying to find something better, something more mind blowing.\"\n\"This is a miraculous thing about this area. It never disappoints,\" he said.\nThese local ingredients are transformed into elegant dishes in Bas Rouge's kitchen, including the restaurant's lunchtime favorite wiener schnitzel, an array of oysters and, when the chefs have it in, a Dover sole that Peet says draws diners from as far as D.C.\n\"It is food that we love and have a passion to cook and eat,\" Peet said. \"I think the idea of taking a raw ingredient from the Chesapeake Bay or from a field delivered to the back door by a forager. What do you do in these small towns? You fish, you hunt, you gather because it is fun. It is part of the lifestyle here. So as far as what the food is about and has to say, the food is about myself and my team taking as much local (as we can), accented with fine imported ingredients because of course you have to have some diversity.\"\n\"We have a hyper focus on what we have right here,\" he said.\nBut beyond the Chesapeake's flora and fauna, Peet said that he has decades of lived experiences on the Eastern Shore from which he draws inspiration.\nHe recalled one time 20 years ago when he was just out of culinary school and his first assignment was on Tilghman Island. He was using oysters in a dish, but he wanted to know where the ingredients came from.\nThere was a bus boy who also worked as a waterman. Peet got an invitation to go oystering.\n\"So I am up there in my sailing gear. And these watermen are laughing at me. They are in white rubber boots and Grundens, and I am out there in Haley Hansen and Patagonia. They said, 'You know we are about to get dirty?' And I said, 'Alright, let's do it.'\"\nHe learned by doing. He learned how oyster tonging works, how dredging works and how patent tonging works. He even learned how certain boats are rigged.\n\"If you don't understand that, then preparing (the ingredient) and serving it lacks a little passion. We have a round-about 360-degree connection with that. Terroir is a number one,\" said Peet. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton leans away from annexing new land in comprehensive plan update\n\n September 10, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 728\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — As planners draft Easton's new comprehensive plan, the town's direction on annexing new land is becoming clear: slow down.At a workshop Monday, the Easton Planning Commission chose to retain language in the comprehensive plan update that discourages new annexations in the next 10 years.\nAs recently as last year, Easton annexed around 17 acres of county land east of U.S. Route 50 between the Royal Farms and Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. It's expected to become an affordable housing project, though the developer will still need town approval on an application.\nTown Council members have indicated concerns about annexing additional land into town, especially as Easton deals with the question of whether it's maxing out on residential growth.\nThe comprehensive plan, last updated in 2010, is undergoing revisions before potential council approval later this year or early next year. It outlines how the town aims to grow in the next decade, touching on areas such as annexation, population growth and traffic.\nOn Monday and at a workshop last month, commission and council members noted that there may be exceptions to the no-annexation rule.\n\"I would have a hard time with being absolute about annexation, saying that that's not happening,\" Ward 2 Councilmember Robert Rankin said on Aug. 25. \"Because there may be exceptions.\"\nThe main exception to completely halting annexation seems to be Easton Point, the development project that seeks to revitalize Port Street and the area around the Tred Avon River. The effort hasn't significantly progressed in recent years, council members say.\nWard 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry said at last month's meeting that Easton Point's redevelopment is \"an enigma.\" She advocated that annexation of the county land in that area be excluded from any no-annexation directive in the new comprehensive plan.\n\"The Easton Point development project's been on the board for almost 20 years,\" Curry said. \"We have to find a way to move that forward if we can.\"\nTown leaders largely agreed that a project like Easton Point rises to the level of an \"extraordinary\" annexation that should be permitted under the comprehensive plan's guidance.\nStill, the plan should emphasize that annexation generally is \"not a priority for the town,\" said Planning Commission member Victoria McAndrews on Monday.\nGROWTH RATE\nHesitation to approve future annexation requests stems, in part, from the town's growth. From 2000 to 2010, the town's population increased 36%, according to census data. In the next decade, growth slowed to 7%, bringing Easton's population from 15,945 to 17,101.\nWhen commission and council members met for a joint workshop in August, the council maintained that the comprehensive plan should include a target growth rate for population. The 2010 version has a 1% annual growth rate, which for the most part hasn't been exceeded. Bumping it up to 1.75% was discussed.\nMichael Ports, the commission's vice chair, said Monday that 1.75% \"makes the most sense.\" But other commission members leaned toward a 1.14% annual growth rate, which is based off of historical trends.\nCommission Chairperson Phil Toussaint agreed with the 1.14% rate, emphasizing that it needs to be at a mark so the Town Council feels comfortable approving the plan as a whole.\nTRAFFIC\nWhen housing projects come to the commission or Town Council for approval, they include traffic impact studies. Developers typically hire a traffic engineering firm to conduct the study of the development's potential impact on traffic backups.\nPlanning Commission members said moving forward, the comprehensive plan needs to demand more thorough traffic reviews. Klein said studies often choose a few intersections next to the project and ignore the town's main arteries, where traffic is already an issue.\nEaston Planning and Zoning Director Miguel Salinas said the best way to expand the scope of a traffic impact study for a development is if town engineers or the State Highway Administration request a larger scope during meetings with the project's traffic engineer.\nTown Engineer Rick Van Emburgh said he wants to continue requiring developers' traffic studies to include a percent change in traffic based on if the development were to be built.\nToussaint said he wants the studies to include more consideration on the impact to pedestrians, not just vehicles. He added that studies should be framed around the town's ongoing Complete Streets study, which is assessing Easton's roads on a large scale.\n\"What we've received in the past as a traffic impact study is going to be worthless for us going forward,\" Toussaint said. \"It's propaganda at this point, prepared by the applicant's engineers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton Town Council vote on cannabis moratorium delayed - Tabled measure leads to heated discussion among council members\n\n October 18, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 710\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - A move by Easton Town Council President Frank Gunsallus to continue a hearing on a proposed cannabis moratorium drew strong reactions from other council members.A tense back-and-forth exchange between Gunsallus and Ward 3 Councilman David Montgomery toward the end of Monday's council meeting stemmed from the council president's executive decision to delay a vote on the moratorium for an additional three weeks.The nine-month moratorium on cannabis businesses, introduced this summer, was originally slated for a public hearing and vote at the council's Sept.18 meeting. The matter had been tabled until Monday so all five council members could be present to vote.The moratorium, if passed, would place a pause on applications, approval, construction, expansion, processing or issuance of building permits for a business that grows, processes or sells cannabis within the Easton town limits.The moratorium would also allow the town to consider and adopt a revised zoning ordinance.Easton's existing zoning ordinance already contains definitions and permitted zoning districts for medical cannabis dispensaries and growing and processing facilities, but does not include language on standards for recreational facilities.Montgomery strongly objected to Gunsallus' continuance, saying the council president did not have the authority to do so. Gunsallus affirmed that he did.\"Sir, you will contain yourself please,\" Gunsallus said, speaking over Montgomery, who started to make a comment.Gunsallus reaffirmed he had the power to continue discussion on the moratorium until the next meeting, explaining that he wanted to wait until the town's planning commission made an additional recommendation later in the week.However, in August, the commission unanimously gave a favorable recommendation to approve the ordinance.Montgomery called for a vote on the continuance, questioning Gunsallus' authority.\"The fact that four of us could reveal that we want to vote now means nothing to you, that you will override the wishes of the council because you are sitting there as the town council president,\" he said.Town Attorney Sharon Van Emburgh chimed in, saying the council can override the president's action. But in the past, the council has typically given members additional time to vote as a courtesy.Montgomery pointed out that the council had already given an additional month for consideration.Gunsallus reemphasized the upcoming planning commission meeting would provide more clarifying information.\"Excuse me, what information will that be?\" Montgomery said.\"(The planning commission's) recommendations, as I've stated, so please contain yourself - you've already spoken more than permissible,\" Gunsallus said.Montgomery motioned to overrule Gunsallus and vote on the ordinance as presented.Ward 2 Councilman Don Abbatiello interjected, saying while he understood Montgomery and \"definitely\" disagreed with how the decision had been handled, he agreed that granting additional time to decide was in line with past council actions.Mayor Megan Cook, a former council president herself, interrupted the quarreling, calling for the councilmen to settle down.\"I agree that we are a group of five where you all are independent and you all have various opinions - absolutely.We must respect ourselves - the fighting, we need to\" she said, trailing off and moving her arms to motion to calm down.\"Please.\" Ward 4 Councilman Rev.Elmer Davis Jr. initially seconded the motion, rescinding his vote just minutes later to agree with Abbatiello's stance on the council's precedent. He voiced worry with how the situation was handled.\"We have never had such a dialogue that we had tonight regarding issues and concerns,\" he said. \"That dialogue - I'm quite concerned about things that have been said, I've never seen this on this council in all my days.\" The council will again table voting on the ordinance until its Monday, Nov. 6, meeting.Uncertainty still remains on the moratorium. During Monday's meeting, council members and town residents raised questions on the moratorium's duration, specifics on licensing for both recreational and medical facilities and zoning laws for both types of establishments.The Easton Planning Commission will discuss zoning requirements for adult-use cannabis dispensaries at its Thursday, Oct. 19, meeting. \n \n Caption: COURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nEaston Town Council President Frank Gunsallus pauses his comments during a tense moment at the Monday, Oct. 16 council meeting.\n \nCOURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nWard 3 Councilman David Montgomery, left, prepares to make a comment during a tense exchange at a council meeting Monday, Oct. 16.\n \nCOURTESY TOWN OF EASTON\n \nEaston Mayor Megan Cook gestures with her hands for the council members to settle down. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It seems like everything comes so easily to her, and it's hard for me not to compare our paths.Recently, my friend received a $10,000 scholarship for a study abroad program in Japan and landed an internship at one of the top investment banking firms in the United States. She applied to only one internship and only one scholarship, and things fell into place effortlessly. It's as if a fairy comes in every night while she's sleeping and throws magic pixie dust at her to make everything work out. Meanwhile, I feel like I have to fight tooth and nail just to make half as much progress. Every day is a continuous struggle to accomplish the goals that I have. I try hard to be positive, but obstacles pop up constantly. How can I deal with these feelings of envy and move forward with a more upbeat outlook on life? - Jealous DEAR JEALOUS: It is understandable that you would be envious of your friend for what appears to be an easy life. As you also know, it is toxic to dwell on what other people have. No good will come out of that longing. Instead, you must focus on yourself. Do your best to view your life as your perfect challenge. You are gaining resilience as you live through each experience.Claim your small victories.To keep on track, create a vision board. Look through magazines and newspapers for images that reflect the things you want for your life. Cut them out. Brainstorm words and ideas that represent your dreams.Write them down. Next, on a large piece of cardboard or paper, place the images and words together. Make a simple art piece out of this collection of ideas to create your vision board. When thoughts creep in about your friend's success - or anyone else's - wish them well and pivot back to planning your own life. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The Port Street Commons, a project led by The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, is slated to finish construction in October.The project includes nine apartments — seven two-bedroom units and two three-bedroom units — and approximately 10,000 square feet of space for The Arc's new regional headquarters, featuring offices and a behavioral health suite.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Jonathon Rondeau, president and CEO of The Arc, gave a tour of the 24,000-square-foot space to Jake Day, Maryland's secretary of housing and community development.\nConstruction workers were in action on the site, and drywall and insulation was installed on the first and second floors of the three-story building. Day called it a \"great looking building.\"\nRondeau pointed out the importance of bringing immediate assistance to those in need of housing in the Easton area, which is why his team has worked to aim for completion in under four years. The site was identified in July of 2021, and construction began last June. \"We want to move quickly,\" Rondeau said.\n$6.5 million of the project's approximate $11-million price tag has been raised, and The Arc is nearing the end of its capital campaign. Rondeau told Day that The Arc is financing the gap of around $4.5 million.\n\"If we wanted to raise the full $11 million, that would've taken us about eight years,\" Rondeau said.\nDay was impressed with the pace of the Port Street project, asking Rondeau, \"can we set you up with lots of other developers to help guide them through the process as speedily as The Arc has gotten through?\"\nA ribbon cutting is planned for Nov. 7. Rondeau said the first batch of tenants will move in Dec. 1, with a second batch coming in on Jan. 2. The Arc's headquarters will open in January.\nEight of the nine units will accept tenants based on a public lottery system. The ninth unit is designated to the Talbot Interfaith Shelter to house someone transitioning out of the shelter.\n\"Because of the site plan, all nine units are slightly different,\" Rondeau said, \"which was not the most economical, but it was the only way we could maximize getting nine units into the available square footage.\"\nAll of the units will feature free Wi-Fi and appliances including a microwave, along with \"solid surface countertops\" and carpet in bedrooms to save money in the back end for property management. The units will be managed by Chesapeake Neighbors, a housing subsidiary of The Arc.\nRondeau said two of the units on the first floor are \"universally designed,\" with accessible bathrooms and appliances meant to accommodate those with disabilities.\nAs Day and other members of the Department of Housing and Community Development toured the space, Rondeau pointed out how the office spaces will support The Arc's overarching goal of providing counseling and assistance to those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.\nThe headquarters are expected to add around 35 jobs to the area. Rondeau said employees at the Easton site will have health insurance. A full-time nurse will also be in the building.\n\"Three years ago, The Arc decided to self-insure our health insurance for our employees,\" he said. \"And we have a partnership. We provide free urgent and primary care to all of our employees.\"\nRondeau is excited for The Arc's services to continue expanding outside of Anne Arundel County, which is where the organization was founded and has the largest presence.\n\"We've grown significantly over the last 25 years here in Easton,\" Rondeau said. \"We wanted to have an Eastern Shore headquarters.\"\nThe project is the first building in Easton to fall under the town's mixed-use waterfront zoning district regulations, Rondeau said. Passed in 2019, the zoning code emphasizes connecting the Easton Point waterfront to the town's downtown area. Rondeau said The Arc made sure to have the front doors of the project facing Port Street as part of the zoning expectations.\nAfter the tour, Day thanked Rondeau and expressed his support for The Arc's fast-moving efforts.\n\"It's an awesome project, it's an incredible project,\" Day said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Now eight months in, the Werners have learned that getting out to Tilghman Island — miles past St. Michaels, where tourists usually stop — is worth the drive.\n\"I hear people all the time. They're like, 'oh, my God, it's so far. I just can't do that drive.' It's the extra 10 minutes passing St. Michaels, and it's just something about that drive,\" Michael said.\nIn an effort to encourage people to come to Tilghman and connect more local businesses, the Werners are purchasing a shuttle van, which can hold around 14 people. They plan to provide shuttle services from St. Michaels and beyond.\nThe current proposed name of the shuttle is \"The Tizzy.\" It will begin operation in next week.\nIn addition, the Werners are planning to purchase a center console boat to provide shuttle service on the water.\nGinafying Tilghman\nGina opened Gina's in St. Michaels in 2011, which she still runs. But she always wanted to buy the property she could operate out of.\nThe new restaurant is situated on Knapps Narrows right next to the historic Tilghman Island Drawbridge.\nIt is the busiest drawbridge in the nation, and on a nice summer day, the bridge could be raised up to 50 times, according to PropTalk Chesapeake Bay Boating.\nThe restaurant sources crabs, oysters and fish directly from local watermen, emphasizing extreme freshness while fostering strong community relationships on the island. Along with local seafood, the Werners make a point of collaborating with local artists and businesses like the Tilghman Island County Store and the Little Big Market.\nGina firmly believes in a \"rising tide raises all ships\" mentality.\nShe was inspired to open her first restaurant, Gina's Cantina, after a bad experience at a restaurant she formerly worked in where she didn't feel supported after returning from maternity leave.\n\"I was working all the way up until eight months pregnant, but I went back and everything changed,\" Gina said. \"It just fueled me.\"\n20 years later, that fuel remains ignited, but not out of spite. Her motivation is fostered through an environment where staff are happy yet hardworking and the customers love the food but also feel at home.\nTo Gina, it is more important to prioritize a relaxed customer experience, where guests can enjoy the view.\n\"I definitely believe that the restaurants have been such a way for me to put my heart out there so I can still do my art and I can also make a living because I'm not selling my art,\" Gina said. \"The art is when people come in and they're like, ah, yeah.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Traffic concerns derail proposed apartment complex - Board of Zoning Appeals denies Aspire Apartments' special exception request\n\n October 26, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 1093\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - After four and a half hours of testimony and deliberations, the Easton Board of Zoning Appeals denied Aspire Apartments' request for a special exception to use a property off of Mathewstown Road as a multifamily apartment complex.Almost every seat was full in the meeting chambers Tuesday evening as supporters and opponents waited for a chance to weigh in on the contentious proposed complex - and to hear the long-awaited decision on the project's requests.Brought forth by Aspire Outdoors LLC, a company owned by Easton resident Derick Daly, the project proposed a six-building, 162-unit apartment complex with 27 units in each building.The property is situated on the south end of Camac Street, southwest of the existing Hunters Mill neighborhood and adjacent to the Gannon Range, previously known as the Estates at Gannon Farm, planned unit development. It's also located within the R-10A zone, a residential district within the Town of Easton.A multifamily apartment complex within the district requires a special exception granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals, which prompted Daly's request.Daly also requested a variance to allow reduction of the rear setback dimension for the apartment buildings and parking area to be reduced from the town zoning code's required 75 feet to 50 feet due to the unusual size and configuration of the area.The project first came before the town planning commission last December, where Hunters Mill residents voiced concerns about traffic and accessibility.The proposal was initially slated to be heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals in April, but was delayed by 180 days to address ongoing concerns.Within the last few months, both town planning staff and the planning commission recommended approval of Daly's application with conditions, which included project phasing, addressing traffic mitigation and ensuring adequate wastewater capacity.The proposed phasing suggestion, which was incorporated into plans shown at Tuesday's meeting, indicated that access to the first phase of buildings would be via Camac Street.The second phase of construction would include access to the complex via Gannon Range and Camac Street. An additional entrance for the third phase of development was yet to be determined.To Daly, inspiration for the apartment complex was drawn from the opportunity to provide \"much-needed housing\" to Easton. About 25% of the profits are going to another one of Daly's ventures: Polaris Village Academy, a free private school located in the Port Street area.Daly said the complex was intended to be a higher-end property to serve employees of the new regional medical center, which has yet to begin construction.Board of Zoning Appeals member Gary Molchan questioned why Aspire Apartments couldn't have its own entrance like other complexes instead of running through residential neighborhoods. Daly said he was limited by wetlands, which would require a different set of approvals.Questions were also raised about the number of parking spaces for the entirety of the complex, the possibility of parking spilling over onto Camac Street and adequate public facilities.A significant portion of the meeting was spent discussing traffic - a primary concern of Hunters Mill residents.Betty Tustin, a senior project manager for The Traffic Group, said once fully developed, the apartment complex would generate 875 average daily trips. The number was one she deemed as sufficient for what was permitted under town standards.But to Troy Brestel, a professional engineer and project manager with Traffic Planning and Design, Inc. who testified on behalf of the project's opponents, said that he agreed with the number of average daily trips listed in the developer's traffic study, but disagreed with amount of average daily trips on Camac Street once the apartments were developed.John Franczak, the vice president of the Hunters Mill Homeowners' Association, led opposition to the apartment complex on behalf of the neighborhood.\"We feel that the town comprehensive plan should be followed, no variances or exceptions,\" he said. \"The rules are there to protect people.\"The Town of Easton is also installing a long-promised park in the neighborhood, which means more young children and families out walking - a dangerous situation if there's heavy traffic flow from an apartment complex, Franczak said.Several members of the public took the opportunity to comment at the end of each side's presentation.The board's discussion on the variance request was brief, with members acknowledging its minimal impact - the property's use was more important. Approval of the variance request was unanimous.More detailed deliberations ensued on the special exception request.Molchan voiced concerns about the change in character of the surrounding area and traffic congestion.\"I would support that the Town of Easton needs apartments like this, but these apartments should not affect a community that already exists,\" he said. \"What we're doing to the people on Camac we're turning a quiet residential neighborhood into a bustling thoroughfare for cars and delivery trucks and contractor vehicles, and that's after the apartments are built, that's not while they're being built. Who knows what that will be?\"Board member Zakary Krebeck raised similar points, speaking about the \"unrealistic\" provision of parking spaces and the impact it would have on Hunters Mill.To board chairman Peter Cotter, traffic and congestion were the two main issues he was grappling with.\"I don't see how it's currently configured, how I can get to a yes using Camac Street,\" he said, \"because I just think that regardless of how the plan is, that's going to be what is used.\"A motion to deny the special exception was promptly voted on, earning a unanimous consensus.In a phone interview Wednesday afternoon, Daly said he was \"disheartened\" by the special exception's denial, but understood why the board chose to do so. Looking forward, he plans to make adjustments to his proposal and come before the board again.Because the board denied the application, Daly must wait a full year before returning with the same proposal, per the town's zoning ordinance. A revised plan could be heard in less than a year if it's substantially different from the previous application. The denial can also be appealed in the county circuit court.In spite of the denial, Daly expressed gratitude to the board for hearing him out, along with thanks for positive recommendations from the planning commission, Easton Utilities and town staff.Franczak said while he didn't think the apartment proposal was bad, the project didn't go well with the adjacent single-family house neighborhood. The opposition wasn't personal; Franczak felt he was allowed to defend his house, neighborhood and the safety of both.\"Bottom line: no hard feelings,\" he said. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT Residents attending the Easton Board of Zoning Appeals meeting on Tuesday, Oct. 24 look to a projector screen with a depiction of the proposed Aspire Apartments complex site plan. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

You pay a small fortune to get it and keep it.Then, if you have the blatant audacity to actually file a claim, the company either increases your premiums or cancels you altogether.OK, that may be a bit extreme, but you get my point.While the world of insurance can at times be so confusing as to be maddening, going without basic automobile coverage is simply not an option. The financial risk is just too great. But there are some things you can do to make sure you don't stand out to the company as an intolerable risk.You should file an auto insurance claim if: There are injuries, even minor ones. It's crucial to report the incident to your insurer to ensure your coverage applies, preventing unexpected bills and safeguarding you from potential lawsuits by injured drivers.Another driver is involved.Contact your insurance company whenever you're in a crash with another driver, especially when fault isn't clear. Reporting the incident to your insurer helps make sure the blame is assigned fairly and shields you from excessive liability.There is damage to vehicles or property. Insurance is there to help you with costs when things get damaged, so you don't have to pay a big lump sum. That's why you pay monthly premiums.You shouldn't file an auto insurance claim if: You are the only person involved. If the incident is your fault and does not involve injuries, not telling your insurance company will help protect your premium.There is only a small amount of damage. Even if you have collision coverage in your car insurance, you might decide not to file a claim if your car has only minor damage.Mary invites you to visit her at EverydayCheapskate.com, where this column is archived complete with links and resources for all recommended products and services.Mary invites questions and comments at https://www.everydaycheapskate.com/contact/, \"Ask Mary.\" CO PYR IGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Bucs, Sabres set sights on titles\n\n March 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 1389\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The postseason is a long ways off, but Saints Peter and Paul High's boys lacrosse team has already faced its toughest competition this season.The Sabres' first five games of the regular season featured Calvert Hall, which is ranked No. 2 nationally in the latest USA Lacrosse Magazine poll, and No. 1 in the state. Sts. Peter & Paul also has had games against three other top-20 ranked teams in Maryland — No. 5 Bullis Prep; No 16. Good Counsel; and No. 19 Severn.\n\"It's everything I wanted,\" Sabres head coach Todd Wolters said of the opening gauntlet. \"I'm very happy with what we have.\"\nThough Sts. Peter & Paul lost its first five games before routing James M. Bennett 17-1 last week, Wolters said he's not concerned with his personal record, but is focused on preparing his team for another run at a Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association B Conference title after falling shy in last year's championship game.\nThough Kent Island has yet to begin its regular season, head coach Bobby Woolley has also been impressed with what he's seen from his team during a tough preseason slate that included dates with No. 18 DeMatha, No. 22 Broadneck and No. 23 South River before Monday's final exhibition against Springside Chestnut Hill Academy of Philadelphia.\n\"We put our necks out there right away and just started learning about ourselves,\" said Woolley, whose preseason also included Sherwood, Fallston, Cape Henlopen and Archmere Academy. \"I feel like we got a lot of what it takes.\"\nEaston will look to send longtime head coach Dennis Keenan off as a winner. The Warriors graduated the majority of their firepower from a year ago, but look to have the goods for another solid season, along with Queen Anne's and North Caroline.\nWhile Keenan begins his farewell tour, two Mid-Shore teams welcome new head coaches, with Ben Joiner taking over at Kent County, and Teddy Peyton at Gunston. There is also a new kid on the block, with North Dorchester beginning its first year of varsity play under the direction of veteran head coach Steve Hurley.\n\"We don't have much experience so we're going to learn a lot of game this year and next year,\" said Hurley, who has 18 out for the team. \"We're having fun; kids are learning.\"\nHere's a look at this year's teams.\nCAMBRIDGE-SD\nHead Coach: Brendan Bromwell.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Andrew McMichael (Sr.); Defense: Christian Dockins (Sr.); Jeffrey Sellman (So.); Juan Slaughter (So.); Midfield: Gavin Weber (So.); Tabrion Watts (Sr.); Kimir Lake (Sr.); Attack: Charles Spedden (Jr.); Gibby Robinson (So.); Nate McClaren (Sr.).\nOutlook: The Vikings are fast and athletic defensively, led by four-year man Dockins. Bromwell applauded McMichael, who has stepped in at goalie.\n\"I'm proud of him,\" Bromwell said. \"We didn't have anybody and Andrew came to me and said, 'Hey, I know we're kind of struggling in this spot, I'll give it a try.' And he's done good.\"\nThere is also athleticism at the midfield with Watts and Lake. Bromwell likes Weber's old-school style of play and will have him facing off.\nSpedden, whose growth in the game is \"insane\", according to Bromwell, quarterbacks the attack.\nEASTON\nHead Coach: Dennis Keenan.\nWho's Where: Goalies: Mason Quicke (So.); Randall Mills (Sr.); Defense: Eddie Whelan (Sr.); Ethan Finlay (Sr.); Max Smith (So.); Nathan Lapp (Sr.); Ethan Ballance (Jr.); Darren Foxwell (Sr.); Midfield: Spencer Gunshenan (So.); Conner Hensley (Sr.); Logan Friend (Jr.); Cole Murphy (So.); Finn Gunshenan (Sr.); Landon Chaney (Sr.); Blake Royer (So.); Colin Keenan (Sr.); Luke Stanco (Jr.); Grayson Buritsch (Jr.); Miles Chaney (So.); Blake Newton (Jr.); Attack: Campbell Taliaferro (Sr.); Jackson Wieland (Jr.); David Rogers (Jr.); Trace Haddaway (So.); Miles Abell (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Warriors lost the bulk of their scoring with the graduation Drew Schmidt (54 points) and Hudson Royer (43 points), who are both at Lynchburg (Va.), and Tyler Rardin (50 points).\nWhile there looks to be plenty of offensive options, Keenan said defense is the team's strength, and was impressed with Quicke's 12-save effort against North Caroline in Friday's opener.\n\"We're building,\" Keenan said. \"They listen. They're willing to be taught.\"\nKENT ISLAND\nHead Coach: Bobby Woolley.\nWho's Where: Goalies: Quinn Burns (Fr.); Chris Lemme (Sr.); Cody Jones (Sr.); Defense: Gavan Henry (Sr.); Ryan Austin (Sr.); Robert Hottel (So.); Eric Hofmann (Sr.); Grayson Corn (So.); Connor Byrne (Jr.); Finn McGrath (So.); Midfield: Keegan Green (Sr.); Connor Gardner (So.); Marshall Dandy (Jr.); Aidan Henry (Sr.); Attack: Mark Rees (Sr.); Brian Rees (Jr.); Colton Schneck (Sr.); Liam Dermer (Sr.); Face-off: Ricky Verger (Sr.); Roy Scott (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Bucs' bid last year for a third consecutive Class 2A state title was foiled in the semifinals by eventual state champ Glenelg. All-North Bayside Offensive Player of the Year Tucker Claxton graduated along with fellow first-team all-North picks Owen Wynot and Micah Quinn.\nBut Woolley thinks this squad is in a more stable place heading into this season compared to last year, when he and his staff seemed to be forever patching holes. A strong returning cast, including all-North first-teamers Gavan Henry and Green, St. Mary's transfers Hottel and Dandy, and promising freshman class figure to have the Bucs challenging for a 10th Bayside Conference title in 13 years.\nBut nobody has thrilled Woolley more than the return of Hofmann, who missed all last season with an injury.\n\"Having Eric back is a game-changer, as far as controlling the field between the restraining lines and putting pressure on people to get the ball into their offensive zone,\" Woolley said.\nThere's been a three-way battle for starting goalie between Lemme, Jones and freshman Burns, who has really turned heads.\n\"All in all, I feel like we're more of a complete team heading into this year than we were last year,\" Woolley said. \"We're positioned with high expectations and talent to back it.\"\nNORTH CAROLINE\nHead Coach: Gavin Houseman.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Koen Jackson (Sr.); Defense: Derek Jones (Sr.); Gabe Holt (So.); Sam Heimbuch (Fr.); Midfield: Jimmy Cohoon (Jr.); Owen Walstrum (Jr.); Dylan Robinson (Jr.); Charlie Fleshman; Attack: Jake Hoofnagle (Fr.); Mason Ratcliff (Jr.); Corey Bunce (Sr.)\nOutlook: The Bulldogs finished .500 in the regular season a year ago, and after a solid outing in Friday's opener against Easton, Houseman thinks there's potential to improve.\n\"We thought we'd have to take a step back with having younger guys taking more of a senior role but we really haven't had to,\" Houseman said. \"We've picked up pretty much where we left off last year. We played pretty strong against Easton. We had minor hiccups, which I think are easy to fix.\"\nQUEEN ANNE'S COUNTY\nHead Coach: Brad Niesz.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Brian Maleski (Jr.); Defense: Brett Bast (Sr.); Ethan Hahn (Sr.); James Rath (Jr.); Conner Cheezum (Sr.); Ryan Lee (Sr.); Brian Patrick; Midfield: Tanner Lyon (Sr.); Conlan Nagle (Sr.); Carter Hercher (So.); Casey Ryan (Jr.); Midfield-Attack: Tyler Crist (Jr.); Charlie Schmidt (Jr.); Jackson Shiley (Jr.); Sam Yetman (Jr.); Attack: Jamison Kendall (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Lions graduated a lot of experience, particularly on the defensive end. Gone is first-team all-North Bayside goalie Dino Blue. Niesz said the loss of defenseman Hunter Kelly will also hurt, but the return of Lee, a first-team choice a year ago, should anchor the defense.\n\"We've had to move around a number of players,\" Niesz said. \"We are a relatively small program in terms of numbers so we're going to ask guys to fill multiple roles.\"\nSAINTS PETER & PAUL\nHead Coach: Todd Wolters.\nWho's Where: Goalie: Hank Wolters (Jr.); Defense: Porter Bishop (Jr.); Daniel Schwaninger (Jr.); Jackson Jancosko (Fr.); Langdon Anderson (Jr.); Cole Philip (Fr.); Drake Stolba (Jr.); Midfield: Grant Messick (Jr.); Lane Williams (Sr.); Mason Roland (Fr.); Jamir Demby (Fr.); Eddie Albright (Fr.); Attack: JJ Rardin (Jr.); Noah Zimmerman (Sr.); Andrew Steinhardt (So.); Liam Durnbaugh (Jr.).\nOutlook: The Sabres lost in last year's MIAA B Conference final to Archbishop Curley, but may be stronger this season.\nThe defense could be among the conference's best with Hank Wolters back in goal, fronted by Bishop, who Coach Wolters has called one of the best in the country, Schwaninger, Jancosko and Anderson.\nThe offense also appears loaded with the return of Rardin, Zimmerman, Steinhardt and Durmbaugh. The biggest concern — other than staying healthy — may be between the restraining lines where the midfield struggled through the first five games.\n\"We're nowhere near full strength,\" Todd Wolters said. \"But they've seen what good teams are like. I'm here to win a B Conference championship and these are the games that will help us.\"\nEditor's Note: Information on Gunston and Kent County was unavailable at press time. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He was the fifth commissioner or acting commissioner in a period of seven months.\nYou have to wonder why the president would have chosen Billy Long to serve as the IRS commissioner in the first place.\nHe was a congressman from Missouri from 2011 to 2023. His background was as an auctioneer and real estate agent. According to news sources, the only tax credentials he had ever received were a designation as a \"certified tax and business adviser,\" a title given after taking a short class from a business in Florida.\nAfter getting his certificate, he was involved with companies that assisted businesses and nonprofits in applying for the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit available in 2020 and 2021 for employers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFrom my own experience as both a tax preparer and taxpayer, I have found the civil servants who work for the IRS are some of the smartest and most competent in the federal government. It makes me wonder how these tax professionals kept up their morale with Mr. Long as the commissioner.\nAdd to that the effects of the DOGE project on IRS employees. Since January of this year, thousands have left the agency.\nMore than 266 million tax returns were filed with the IRS in fiscal year 2024, collecting more than $5 trillion in tax revenue and $98 billion in enforcement revenue.\nGiven the enormous, looming debt we are facing, tax revenue is crucial to keep the government functioning and to pay the interest due on this debt.\nI feel fortunate to live in a country where, at least until now, I can file my tax returns and feel confident that they will be processed by an agency that abides by the rules, keeps my records confidential, sends me refunds or credits my payments in an orderly and efficient manner.\nStability and consistency in tax administration are also necessary for a thriving American business community.\nThe IRS deserves good leadership in order to maintain public trust. A healthy U.S. financial system depends on a well-functioning Internal Revenue Service.\nELAINE TAMA\nEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Arthur Ellis (D-Charles) introduced a bill on the first day of the General Assembly that would create something that Maryland has never had before — a state fruit.Native to Maryland, persimmons can be found just about everywhere in the state, with the exception of Garrett County due to the mountainous nature of the region.\nIn May and June, persimmon trees flower, but the fruit isn't ready until the fall, leading to many seasonal recipes and drinks. Persimmons have especially been used for fine wines, jams and baked goods.\nThe trees are known for their resilience, being able to thrive for years when they are below the canopy of a forest.\nPrices for persimmons have gone up significantly in recent years, reaching about $6 per pound, and many have not heard how easy it may be to source their own, according to Ellis.\n\"I have persimmon trees in my yard,\" Ellis said. \"They grow naturally, and they're beautiful and delicious.\"\nEllis introduced the legislation to raise awareness for the fruit, as many Marylanders do not realize it is a part of their state and its history.\nIndigenous people of the region used the fruit not only for food but medicinally as well. Sore throats and indigestion were common ailments that the use of persimmons attempted to treat.\nThroughout the Civil War, persimmon seeds were used as a coffee substitute when trade routes were impacted.\nThe usefulness of the persimmon tree doesn't end with the fruit. The wood of the tree is extremely strong, and is commonly used within shoes, golf clubs, flooring and musical instruments.\nIf Senate Bill 74 makes it through both state legislative houses and is signed by the governor, it would become effective Oct. 1.\nTwitter: @MattSoMdNews \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — John North was more than just a well-respected judge.The former Talbot County state's attorney and judge of the District and Circuit courts wore many hats during his professional and retired life, serving as a protector of the Chesapeake Bay, log canoe racing aficionado and vintage automobile enthusiast.\nIn recent days, family, friends and the Talbot County community have remembered North for his roles in all of those capacities and more.\nNorth died in St. Michaels on Sept. 19. He was 94.\nOldest son David North remembered his father as \"competitive with compassion.\" He was supportive and thorough in everything he did, his son said.\n\"Right through the end, he was showing us how to have fun under not very good circumstances and how to stay competitive,\" David North said. \"And how to laugh.\"\nNorth was Talbot County state's attorney from 1962 to 1971. He then served as judge for 12 years in District Court and five years in Circuit Court before his appointment as the first chairman of the Maryland Critical Area Commission, the state agency responsible for protecting the health of the Chesapeake Bay and enforcing laws at a local level.\nPete Lesher, current Talbot County Council vice president, reflected on North's impact with the commission and as one of the founders of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in the 1960s.\n\"He lived and played on Chesapeake waters,\" said Lesher, also the museum's chief historian. \"He valued the health of these waters and I think relished that role of caring for them in the capacity of the Critical Area regulation.\"\nRen Serey, former executive director of the Critical Area Commission, worked closely with North for many years. \"The Judge,\" as North was widely known, brought the necessary judicial expertise and temperament to chair the commission, Serey said.\nNorth was responsible for implementing local critical area programs at a time when the Bay's environmental needs clashed with rural growth and development patterns, Serey said. But North struck the perfect balance in adjudicating such matters.\n\"Having Judge North up there at the head of the table facing 29 people who were debating these issues was just the perfect role for him,\" Serey said. \" ... He knew how to listen, he knew how to interject, he knew how to keep the discussion without certain boundaries.\"\nThose that worked closely with North said he was widely trusted for his fairness and loyalty.\nLesher recalled a time in the early 2000s when the state committed funds for repairs to the Chesapeake Bay's skipjack fleet. But the state didn't fully lay out how the money would be doled out among skipjack captains in Tilghman Island and Deal Island.\nJudge North, though, stepped in.\n\"Who was going to be the trusted arbiter if it came down to a Deal Island versus Tilghman Island? It was Judge North,\" Lesher said. \"He was trusted by these watermen.\"\nNorth's wife of 64 years, Ethel Towers North, died in 2019. He is survived by sons David and Daniel and their wives Joan Hoge-North and Margaret Enloe-North, along with grandchildren Drew North, Dylan North, Campbell North, William Spencer North and Nathaniel Vivian, and former daughters-in-law, Sallie North and Carrington North. He is also survived by Comber McHugh, a companion of later years.\nIn addition to his esteemed roles with the courts and the Critical Area Commission, North was a local log canoe captain. He wrote a book on sailing log canoes, which was published by the Maritime Museum in 2018.\n\"The Judge\" skippered Island Bird, the 27-foot-4-inch log canoe built by North's great-grandfather in 1882.\nDavid North said his younger brother Daniel took up his dad's sailing hobby. They both have kids who continue sailing on the Chesapeake Bay.\n\"It's a piece of our family. It's a piece of our heritage,\" David North said.\nIn his spare time, \"The Judge\" was a lover of feral cats, a keen reader and a sculptor. Some of his sculpting works are displayed at The Trippe Gallery in Easton.\nDavid North said he followed his dad's footsteps in the world of automobile restoration and car shows. Judge North especially loved Bugattis and Duesenbergs.\nNorth was a founder of the St. Michaels Concours d'Elegance, an annual car showcase nearing its 20-year mark. Luke Phipps, the festival's current chair, said it began as simply an oyster roast at North's house in St. Michaels, where friends of \"The Judge\" would bring their vintage cars to his front lawn. Then, the tradition grew into a solidified event.\nThe 18th St. Michaels Concours d'Elegance was hosted Sept. 26-28 at the Kent Island Yacht Club. Despite heavy rain the night before the festival's last hurrah on Sept. 28, Phipps said it was a \"beautiful\" and sunny Sunday.\nPhipps said all he could think of was North — a close friend and valuable mentor — smiling down on Sunday.\nHe recalled North as a \"sharp\" and an \"eloquently spoken\" man.\n\"There'll never be another one like him,\" Phipps said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Trappe Planning Commission approves changes to Lakeside plans\n\n August 28, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: Local News \n \n 321\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n TRAPPE — Last Tuesday evening, Trappe's Planning Commission approved the changing of three lots set aside for spray irrigation into one parcel for the Lakeside Wastewater Treatment Plant. This change will help the plan meet requirements from the Talbot County Health Department.Ryan Showalter, Lakeside's attorney, said new representatives of the Health Department had waited to provide comments on the preliminary and final plans for Lakeside until they receive approval from the Maryland Department of the Environment.\nMDE requested two changes to the final plan. The first relates to the Health Department's signature approval block. The approval block before referenced the parcels that are associated with the treatment plan. According to Showalter it basically said they're approved as lots for development purposes.\nThe second change pertains to the lots for the spray irrigation field. According to Showalter, there were three lots for the spray field, which was everything north of the treatment plant, the storage lagoon and the reserve spray field was a lot.\nMDE is requesting all the lots to be on a single parcel, essentially erasing boundary lines on the plan.\n\"And so that's the only change, is to remove those internal division lines so that what was three lots is now Lot C.\"\nAccording to Robert Rauch, this change in no way alters the boundaries or acreage of the parcels.\n\"We had three parcels associated with the spray field they wanted to incorporate into a single parcel,\" he said. \"Didn't change any of the boundaries. Didn't change every acreage, but we had to switch them to a single parcel instead of three separate ones.\"\nThe planning commission unanimously approved a motion to authorize Commission President Edgar to sign the revised plats when they are approved by the Health Department and MDE.\nRauch shared with the commission that the wastewater treatment plant is now meeting effluent requirements and the Health Department and MDE approved that the treatment plant can start discharging to the lagoon starting last week. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Encounter with Jimmy Carter provides memories\n\n October 5, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: LINDA EVANS | Section: Columns \n \n 724\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Editor's note: This column originally appeared in the Star Democrat on Oct. 17, 2021. It is repeated here after Jimmy Carter celebrated his 100th birthday this week.It was the mid-seventies and I was a young Washington, D.C., Republican staffer with the rare opportunity to work as a personal assistant for the Honorable and Mrs. George Romney (Mitt Romney's parents).\nPretty exciting for a farm girl from the Eastern Shore of Maryland. When the Romneys invited me out to formal occasions, as a member of their staff, I was occasionally mistaken for Mitt's sister, Lynn.\nIt was cherry blossom time, and a longtime friend who drove me to the Tidal Basin that day happened to be an employee of the Secret Service. As we walked around the Tidal Basin, a long, black limousine pulled up and my friend yelled, \"It's the president.\"\nI nonchalantly responded, \"The President of what? What company?\"\nHe repeated, \"It's President Carter! It's Carter!\nAs a government employee, he knew to position us near where the president's car door would open, with the idea of taking a photograph of the president, if possible. When President Carter emerged from the limousine, I was indeed one of the first in line, and even though I was a staunch Romney Republican, I did what any American would do, outstretched my hand and shook the hand of the president of the United States. Many would be lost for words at that point, but I somehow found the presence of mind to say sincerely, \"Thank you for being our president.\"\nPresident Carter, apparently touched by my sincerity, thanked me. My friend had his old Polaroid camera with him and asked the president if he would mind posing for a photo. The president quickly agreed, and then said to no one in particular: \"Isn't she beautiful?\"\nWhat a compliment for me. I smiled for my friend's camera and that was the end of the exchange; my friend and I were off to tour the cherry blossoms with hundreds, possibly thousands of others that evening.\nThe Polaroids turned out so-so, but my friend, being politically minded, said he had seen White House photographers there. In fact, since I had my new black velour jacket over my arm, he said he felt the Secret Servicemen were carefully watching me for the president's safety.\n\"Why don't you call the White House and see if any of them got you on film?\" he suggested. What an outlandish thought, but tempting. The next day, I looked up the White House switchboard number and hesitantly dialed 212-456-1414, and asked for the White House press secretary, as I had been instructed by my friend.\n\"Hello, this is Karl Schumaker,\" the voice on the phone answered with a German accent. Since I am also of German descent, we had something in common. I said, \"Sir, you won't believe it, but the president of the United States told me I was beautiful yesterday at the Tidal Basin. \"\nPause.\n\"What were you wearing?\" he asked.\n\"I was wearing a pink jumpsuit and pink scarf.\"\n\"You are beautiful,\" Karl said. \"I have three photographs of you. Would you like me to mail them to you or would you like to come to the White House and pick them up this week?\"\nI chose the date of Thursday that week because my sister would be in town, and we not only got autographed photos that day, but a tour of the Oval Office and presidential memorabilia. I showed the photos to our parents and then I filed them in my big, old file cabinet, with only one of the photos on my office wall, seen by almost no one. I'm still a Romney Republican and always will be, but also a Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter fan.\nAnd a fan of someone else in the White House, the Press Secretary Karl Schumaker, who would teach the importance of customer service and taking extra time out to make memories that have lasted over 40 years. It was President Carter's birthday on Oct. 1 (he turned 100), and he received the Nobel Peace Prize also on Oct. 11 (in 2002), which reminded me of this occasion.\n\"To this day, Jimmy Carter looks back on a life of faith and service, and ahead to a more peaceful world,\" Mark K. Updegrove wrote in an article titled \"Building a Better World,\" found in in Parade Magazine, Feb. 18, 2018. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton considers ordinance to crack down on seafood processing odors\n\n November 8, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 811\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Amid resident concerns, the Easton Town Council is considering an ordinance to adjust zoning and place restrictions on seafood processors.The legislation, sent to the council for review following approval from the Planning Commission, was created in response to odor complaints from residents living near the business Chesapeake Brand Seafood on Maryland Avenue.\nAt Monday's Town Council meeting, councilmembers heard mixed reviews on the ordinance from residents and business owners, opting to leave the public hearing open and explore options such as moving the business out of a residential area.\nUnder the ordinance's proposed definition, seafood processing would be defined as \"harvested seafood\" being \"cleaned, cut, eviscerated or otherwise prepared or cooked for sale in bulk, with a resulting by-product.\"\nIf approved, seafood processing would remain permitted in the industrial zoning district but only allowed in business commercial through a special exception. That exception would require that by-products are \"stored within a closed or refrigerated vehicle,\" with operators required to install \"odor control technology\" so \"no odor from any product or by-product can be detected outside the building.\"\nWard 4 Councilmember the Rev. Elmer Davis, who said he's heard the complaints from many of his constituents, took issue with the fact that the proposed ordinance requires existing businesses to comply by Jan. 1, 2026 instead of sooner.\n\"I don't think it's fair for the individuals who live in that area to have to go through another summer dealing with the odor,\" Davis said. \"It's unfair. So I'm going to advocate that it be six months.\"\nDavis added he doesn't think seafood processing should be allowed in business commercial zoning at all. Ward 2 Councilmember Don Abbatiello agreed with Davis' perspective but asked that the council consider the legislation's potential impacts on other seafood businesses.\n\"My only concern would be that we have several other seafood facilities in town who don't have these issues,\" Abbatiello said. \"And I would hate to see them get caught up in a similar scenario, where they're getting, for lack of a better term, punished.\"\nCouncil President Frank Gunsallus asked if the town had a plan to aid smaller seafood businesses if they're forced to comply with the costly odor mitigation requirements.\n\"If we're going to be potentially imposing regulations on businesses that have significant financial impact to the point which some have claimed would put them out of business, I think we should take pause with that,\" Gunsallus said.\n\"I'm not quite concerned about that, personally,\" Davis responded. \"I'm more concerned about the constituents in the neighborhood. … What you're just saying (makes) it seem like it's a hardship on the business when they probably haven't even tried.\"\nZach Smith, attorney for Chesapeake Brand Seafood owner/operator Mitchell Hughes, provided a letter to the council to be read aloud during the public hearing on the ordinance.\nIf passed, the ordinance \"will put Mitchell out of business and will cause significant economic harm to him, his families, his employees and the local watermen that he supports,\" Smith wrote.\nThe attorney said Hughes has taken \"reasonable steps\" to mitigate the impact on residents as they have brought up concerns. However, he says buying new equipment isn't doable.\n\"While Mitchell has tried to be a good neighbor, he cannot reasonably install equipment that prohibits any smell from being detected outside of his building,\" Smith wrote. \"Mitchell has looked into what will be necessary to satisfy this proposed regulation, and such technology is not feasible and will be extremely cost prohibitive.\"\nRESIDENT CONCERNSDuring the public hearing, many residents voiced impacts Hughes' business has had on their quality of life. Resident Philip Bernot said he's lived next to grain processors, metal fabricators and plumbers at the site since 2001, never before experiencing any issue that brought him to a town meeting.\n\"Not a single one of these businesses has ever brought me up here to complain,\" Bernot said. \"Not a single one of these businesses has repeatedly caused a gut-wrenching stench to take over the entire neighborhood.\"\nA representative for Sea Watch International said the business on Glebe Park Drive would be \"swept up into new legislation.\" Bruce Cole, owner of Cole's Seafood House & Deli, echoed this, saying the ordinance would negatively impact his operation on North Washington Street.\n\"(The) impact that he has is going to impact me,\" Cole said, noting equipment may cost around $100,000. \" … I don't have any complaints.\"\nFollowing the public hearing, Ward 1 Councilmember Maureen Curry asked the council to pause on taking action. She emphasized the operation of the business under scrutiny is different from businesses like Cole's.\n\"They're not doing it for retail, they're doing it for wholesale and to push out a product,\" Curry said. The council left the public hearing open for the Nov. 18 meeting.\nCurry added that she hopes the council can work toward a \"best case scenario\" in which Chesapeake Brand Seafood moves out of its current location to a more appropriate one away from residents. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Highs are expected to remain in the 90s later in the week across Caroline, Dorchester and Talbot counties.\nThe Dorchester County Health Department is encouraging people stay out of the sun when temperatures peak in the late mornings and early afternoons.\nA press release from the department noted the following groups should take added precautions: babies, young children, pregnant women, older adults, outside workers and those without air conditioning.\nLocal health officials recommend regularly hydrating, limiting time outdoors and monitoring for signs of heat exhaustion — heavy sweating, cold skin, cramps, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, etc.\nThe Maryland Department of Health said in a press release this week that Maryland saw 26 heat-related deaths last year. The state department added that parents and guardians should never leave children in cars.\n\"Remember to check on those who are particularly vulnerable to heat, including young children, senior citizens, and people with chronic diseases — and confirm that they have the resources they need to stay safe during the hottest months,\" said Maryland Secretary of Health Dr. Meena Seshamani in the release.\nEASTON FIRE PREPARES\nAs temperatures heat up, volunteer fire departments across the Mid-Shore remain on call. Due to the physically intensive work of firefighting and the heavy gear that must be worn, some departments are asking for water donations from the community.\nEaston Volunteer Fire Department Chief J.R. Dobson says his department has received enough cases of water from thoughtful community residents and businesses to get through next week's heat wave. Dobson is encouraging residents to contribute to other fire departments in need in Talbot County.\nWhether it's lending bottled waters or assisting with manpower on a call, Dobson says local fire departments work together well.\n\"The other fire chiefs talk a lot, and we're always here to help one another,\" Dobson said.\nThe fire chief noted that as farmers in the area start to cut their wheat, field fires could pop up, a risk fire officials are keeping their eyes on.\nWeather projections are accurate as of Friday afternoon. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "James saves U.S. from big upset\n\n July 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: News \n \n 831\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n LeBron James saved the U.S. from what would have been a stunning loss.James' layup with 8 seconds left was the go-ahead basket Saturday, and the U.S. Olympic team that'll soon head to the Paris Games escaped with a 101-100 win over South Sudan in London, rallying from a 16-point deficit to avoid perhaps the biggest upset in the program's history.\nSouth Sudan, the African nation that gained its independence just 13 years ago and is about to play in the Olympics for the first time, led for more than half the game and had a chance to win at the end. But Carlik Jones' runner off the glass missed with about 4 seconds left, and the Americans survived.\n\"I'm going to be honest: I like those better than the blowouts,\" James said as he walked off the court. \"At least we get tested.\"\nOh, they got tested — by a team that came into the game as 43.5-point underdogs , according to BetMGM Sportsbook.\n\"A good reminder that when we play against teams, it's the biggest game of their lives,\" U.S. coach Steve Kerr said. \"We have to expect everyone to play like that.\"\nDown by 16 at one point, the Americans dug out of that hole with an 18-0 run in the second half — then needed heroics at the end anyway. JT Thor's 3-pointer with 20 seconds left gave South Sudan a 100-99 lead, then the Americans called timeout and put the ball in James' hands.\nHe made it look easy: He waited, waited, waited, then drove and laid it in with ease to put the U.S. back on top, and the Americans got the stop they needed at the end.\nJames finished with a game-high 25 points, six rebounds and seven assists for the U.S., which improved to 4-0 with one game left — Monday vs. World Cup champion Germany — on its pre-Olympic exhibition tour. Anthony Davis added 15 points and 11 rebounds for the Americans.\nMarial Shayok had 24 points for South Sudan and Jones had a triple-double — 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists.\nThe teams will meet in group play in the Paris Olympics on July 31.\n\"It's basketball. It happens,\" U.S. guard Stephen Curry said. \"You want to play perfect every game; it doesn't happen. But can you dig deep and do the little things that help you win? Offense can come and go, but defense is the thing that helps you win championships, medals, all that stuff.\"\nIt should have been a mismatch, and for the first half, it was — just not in the way anyone would have expected.\nThe U.S. roster has 12 players, all of them All-Stars or NBA champions or both, with a total of 189,038 points in their regular-season careers, with 7,832 combined starts. South Sudan has four players who have appeared in an NBA game. They've scored a combined 1,228 points and started 19 games.\nDidn't matter. It was 8-0 U.S. after 2 1/2 minutes. The rest of the half: South Sudan 58, U.S. 34. The Americans allowed South Sudan to shoot 61% in the first half and got outscored 21-3 from 3-point range in the first 20 minutes.\n\"I did not do a great job preparing our team,\" Kerr said. \"We did not focus enough on what they're capable of, and that's on me. I think that really allowed South Sudan to gain confidence early. ... They were great. They played a wonderful game and the ending was good for us, just to feel that, to feel what it's going to be like in Paris and Lille.\"\nAn 18-0 run in the second half — James involved in most of it — was what really saved the U.S., turning a 76-65 deficit into an 83-76 lead.\nSouth Sudan led by 16 late in the first half — 58-42 — before the Americans got the last basket to cut the deficit to 14 at the break.\nBut the 18-0 run was key. James had four assists during the spurt and Curry, from about 35 feet, connected on a 3-pointer late in the third that gave the U.S. its first lead since the first quarter at 79-76.\nWenyen Gabriel banked in a 3-pointer to get South Sudan within 85-84, but James — his former teammate with the Los Angeles Lakers — connected on a 3 on the ensuing U.S. possession, and the Americans would eventually pull through by the slimmest of margins.\n\"Today we were able to represent our country with pride and we put up a good fight and showed the potential of our country,\" Gabriel said. \"I think it was a proud moment for a lot of people.\"\nDavis said the team got to the arena late, thrown off by standstill London traffic, and that routines going into the game were disrupted. Maybe so, but South Sudan showed the U.S. that nobody at the Olympics will concede anything to the four-time defending gold medalists.\n\"Doesn't matter when it comes to how close the game is,\" James said. \"We went out there to get better.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Limits on how much a drug should cost\n\n September 8, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Susan Estrich | Page: A6 | Section: News \n \n 602\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The U.S. government last week released the list of the 10 medications that will be the first to be the subject of the new price negotiations under the Medicare reform bill, and my arthritis drug, Enbrel, made the list.To make the cut, you either had to be taken by millions of people, like Eliquis, or cost a fortune. Enbrel costs a fortune.I'm one of 47,000 Medicare recipients lucky enough to receive a drug that my old rheumatologist, who originally prescribed it for me, described as a miracle.When he was a young doctor, he told me, his waiting room of patients with rheumatoid arthritis was full of crippled people. With the advent of \"biologic\" drugs like Enbrel, the crutches and wheelchairs are gone. I count myself very lucky to be mostly symptom-free, which, with RA, is saying a lot. As I say, I'm lucky and blessed. And well-insured.And able to cover the out-ofpocket costs. Which are also substantial.This is the hard part of medical miracles.One month, when I was switching insurance companies, I ran out of Enbrel. I made the mistake of thinking I could actually pay for my weekly shot out-of-pocket if I couldn't get the insurance situation straightened out. \"How much would it be?\" I naively asked the pharmacist. Enbrel is a SureClick pen; it comes in a pack of four. That would be $1,700 for one pen and $7,000 for the pack.Excuse me? Who can afford that?I managed to get a sample from the doctor's office to tide me over and never asked again. Every month when the specialty pharmacy calls me to renew my Medicare prescription, they confirm my $350 co-pay and I don't so much as murmur a word of complaint, because what can I say? The drug saves my life. But I'm lucky I can afford it. That's why Enbrel belongs on the list.Medicines like Enbrel cost billions to develop, and it is only fair that those costs be recouped. But there are limits, and there is no reason that the market should be foreclosed from working freely when it comes to the prices for these prescription drugs. Enbrel costs too much, but there is nothing that I, one consumer, can do about it. We need to stand together, which is to say, we need government to stand up for us and negotiate for us and give voice to our needs.What is stunning about these negotiations is that it took an act of Congress to authorize the government to use the power of the people on behalf of the people to negotiate fair drug prices.The power of the pharmaceutical industry was so great, so much greater than the power of the American people, that it was literally the law of the land that Medicare could not use its bargaining power on behalf of the American taxpayer.When the bill allowing price negotiation passed last year, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the program would save Medicare more than $100 billion during the next 10 years.Just stop and consider that for a moment: the biggest purchaser of health services unable to use its bargaining power, on behalf of you and I, leaving the industry's power to set prices unchecked. And yet this is precisely what government is for, precisely what government is meant to do, to stand up for and give voice to we the people. The pharmaceutical industry continues to fight against negotiations in the courts. \"Today is the start of a new deal for patients where Big Pharma doesn't just get a blank check at your expense and the expense of the American people,\" President Joe Biden said in announcing the list.It's about time.COPYRIGHT 2023 CREATORS.COM \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Delmarva Pride Center brings new world with Dungeons and Dragons\n\n February 1, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 824\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — In the tavern of a formerly demolished village, a group of brave adventurers is approached by well-dressed, albeit frail-looking, elders who offer a reward of 700 gold to whoever is brave enough to investigate the lizard folks lair in order to gather information on their military weapons.Lauren Fierman, a board member of the Delmarva Pride Center and host of the center's Dungeons and Dragons program, moves around the conference room of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship in Easton.\nWith every sentence, Fierman provides history, landscape and heart to the world the group of players has carefully developed.\nDelmarva Pride Center hosts an open-for-all Dungeons and Dragons, a fantasy tabletop role-playing game, on the fourth Saturday of the month.\nWhat started as a small game event has turned into a growing community, providing a safe environment during a heightened political climate for members of the LGBQT+ community and allies to explore gender identity, sexuality and imagination.\nFierman, who acts as dungeon master (game organizer and participant in charge of creating details and challenges for the game), said the game understands and respects the personal boundaries of its players.\nFrom allowing players to choose the character's pronouns to deciding whether or not they will act out in regional accents, the comfortability of players is key to a successful game.\nIn Fierman's experience, Dungeons and Dragons provided the first space for them to use different pronouns.\n\"I'm playing with gender, (and) I'm playing with sexuality in my characters, and it's just such a wonderful avenue to explore different identities and sexualities,\" Fierman said. \"As a fluid person myself, it was very healthy for me to be in a very safe space with people that I trust to express those parts of me through this game.\"\nAllie Silver, one of the local group's players, said historically Dungeons and Dragons has had a white, straight, male focus. But in recent years, the game has been claimed by LGBTQ+ people who have found the fantasy and community aspect comforting, especially if they feel isolated.\n\"Just creating that space of safety for yourself and for the people at your table is so important because it can become such a beautiful thing,\" Silver said. \"And it's OK if it's not transcendent. If you just play a silly game and kill a bunch of goblins, that's fun.\n\"But just the joy of friendship at the table of community collaboration is what makes this game so good. Especially now more than ever, community is what we need.\"\nThough character building is an important aspect of the game, other players said the game provides an opportunity for them to create LGBTQ+ representation that is frequently left out in the media.\nZack Parreco, a player, said often LGBTQ+ characters' stories use \"queerness\" as something that is othering and aimed at larger audiences to gawk at. In Dungeons and Dragons, LGBTQ+ people can build characters and stories where they can control what is important and what is normal.\n\"There is no pressure for queerness to be a performance for others. It is allowed to just exist,\" Parreco said. \"Maybe we make it big or maybe it's just a normal trait in the world. Either way, we get to fully control our queerness and its expression.\"\nOutside of the game world, players are able to take aspects of their fictional characters into their real lives. Some bring with them new pronouns, and others, like Silver, bring back more courage.\nSilver shared that when she started playing, she was \"an anxious little mouse,\" and, when she was comfortable, she began playing a bold character whose main trait was being able to stand up for everybody.\n\"It was a really fun character, and in the process it gave me permission to find my own courage in my real life and now, in my professional life,\" Silver said. \"I'm an adviser for a Pride group. I volunteer in a bunch of different spaces, and I work to help people and I think that's something eight years ago I would have been terrified to do.\"\nAccording to Fierman, this space is particularly important due to the rise in policies rolling back LGBTQ+ protections since President Donald Trump's inauguration. These policies include executive orders prohibiting gender-affirming health care for those under 19 and designating that the country recognizes only two sexes.\nFierman said now more than ever community and joy needs to be prioritized. This game provides a space to escape from the pressures of the outside and create a physical, mental and emotional space for anyone that needs to get away.\n\"The goal of a lot of these anti-LGBTQ policies and misinformation is to take away our joy. They want us to go away, and I think combating hate with love and combating hate with joy is the most powerful thing you can do because that's what's going to keep us going. That's what kept our community fighting back for generations.\"\nDelmarva Pride Center hosts monthly events including Gender Expression Movement, Elder and Intergeneration Social and Parents and Allies Groups. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "The Zebra Gallery: a place for 'evolutionary' artists\n\n September 20, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Veronica Fernandez-Alvarado | Section: News \n \n 696\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — For Susa Schauer, art has stayed consistent in her life no matter her career. Whether it was being a professional woodturner or a neuroscientist, her heart has kept its love for creativity.Schauer's The Zebra Gallery has provided Easton with a collection of \"evolutionary\" art and artists.\nHer journey to opening the business began during the COVID-19 pandemic, when she was diagnosed with cancer. She described her diagnoses as a wake-up call. It pushed her to make her dream gallery a reality.\n\"I thought if I'm ever going to open a gallery, maybe I should (now),\" Schauer said. \"Life is short. So this beautiful spot across in the Tidewater came open, and I kind of leapt into it.\"\nSchauer's decision to not wait allowed her to create a place that would not only help her through the pandemic and her illness, but also helped her establish a community she loved.\nSchauer said her choice in name for her gallery came as a bit of surprise to her. She did not have a particular connection with zebras growing up, but one day she received a text from her daughter-in-law saying her grandson, who was 3 years old at the time, had just been diagnosed at Johns Hopkins with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, an illness that affects the skin, joints and blood vessels.\nAfter some research, she learned the symbol for Ehlers Danlos Society is a zebra. The symbol called to her and she decided to name her gallery after the animal. Additionally, she made a commitment to give 10% of proceeds to Ehlers Danlos research.\n\"So I took the name Zebra Gallery, and thought it was destined to be,\" Schauer said. \"It has made just perfect sense for me in terms of where I am in my life, making this more than just about me, selling other people's art, but in fact, also giving back to some degree. So it feels like a really nice circle.\"\nNow, Schauer's gallery features local and international artists. Schauer said when looking for artists to feature in her gallery she seeks art that is evolving, risk-taking and intriguing. Though she has a love for traditional art, she said she wants to help foster high-end art with a contemporary spin.\nIn her own work, she has worked in a variety of media including portrait painting, woodturning and thread painting.\nIngrid Matuszewski, a featured artist at the Zebra Gallery, said she had been a long time admirer of Schauer's art and it has been a pleasure to work with Schauer in her gallery. Matuszewski, who got into portrait painting later in life, said working with Schauer has established a community of growth for her and her art.\n\"I think Easton has amazing galleries, so I think the Zebra Gallery complements the other ones in a way that maybe hasn't been there before and represented before because it's more of a contemporary take on art,\" Matuszewski said. \"I think Susan tries to get in touch with artists who just kind of have different viewpoints on things.\"\nAdam Himoff, a muralist at the Zebra Gallery, said Schauer's gallery is the first gallery he had been featured in. Her excitement for his work was magnetic, and her love for art in general drew him in.\n\"I met Susan, and she lights up a room and has some amazing energy,\" Himoff said. \"And we talked about my art and her art, and I shared photos of my other work. She had seen the mural before. And she was amazing. She just lit up, and without a millisecond passing just expressed so much excitement and interest in the work. And so it just seems clear that energy was very convincing.\"\nSchauer said she loves the people on the Eastern Shore, and the opportunity to have her gallery feature local talent, she said, has been wonderful.\n\"There really are so many spectacular people in this town and visiting this town, it's why I came here from grad school and never left 40 years ago,\" Schauer said. \"It's a beautiful area, and we have a remarkable group of both artists and buyers, and they're all wonderful people who have great stories to tell. So every day is a kind of learning and creating.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Johnny Mautz, R-37, and Del. Chris Adams, R-37B.\"When you look at the news and walk down the street, you know now, more than ever, we need prayer amongst the business community and our political leaders,\" Adams said.Mautz said the morning was \"very significant\" and called for applause to mark the occasion.The guest speakers were two local servant-leaders who work primarily with youth and are active in their local churches. They shared very different testimonies of how they see God working in their lives and the lives of others.Claudia Reyes emigrated from Guatemala as a child and serves in Hispanic youth ministries with her husband Eliud, the pastor of First Hispanic Baptist Church in Easton. They have been married for 29 years and have four children.Her ministry in the Talbot County Detention Center, where she hears stories of addiction and exploitation, has convinced her that \"evil is all around us.\" \"We live in bad times, and if you saw the news last night or have seen the news for a couple weeks, you know exactly what I'm talking about. I can assure you that God sees the evil and through God, lives are being transformed,\" Reyes said. \"As much as we have seen evil and destruction here in our community, we see more of God's grace and mercy.\" Referring to the rise of drug addiction and sex trafficking she is aware of, Reyes said, \"Our youth here in our community are not for sale for evil. They are to be rescued.They are to be saved.\" Reyes encouraged attendees to pray because \"prayer is very powerful,\" to become aware of the problems youth face and to \"do something.\" Raised on a farm near Cordova and active in the 4-H program, Linda Saathoff Brown is a lifelong member of Immanuel Lutheran Church. She called herself a \"farm girl, teacher, wife, mother and Nana.\" She has been married to Wesley Brown for 46 years and has taught in Talbot County Public Schools for 47 years.Sprinkling her talk with Bible verses and contemporary praise song lyrics, Brown shared \"My Story, God's Glory,\" borrowing a title of one of her favorite songs by Matthew West.On the exact one-year anniversary of a surgery following a life-threatening fall that could have left her paralyzed, Brown shared ten miracles she said were evidence of God healing her through the prayers of friends from Cordova to Trinidad.Despite dire indications that she may never walk again because of five vertebrae that were either \"crushed or cracked,\" Brown was able to return home without a walker and celebrate Thanksgiving with Amish friends from Lancaster, who brought a van load of food and the greeting, \"Our fervent prayers are answered,\" she said.\"Thanksgiving took on a whole new meaning\" and she \"has been blessed beyond measure,\" Brown said.Local clergy reading scripture and leading prayers were the Rev. Demetrius Price of Union Baptist Church; the Rev. Elmer Davis, a district superintendent in the Peninsula-Delaware Conference of The United Methodist Church; Kennedy Siaw, youth minister of Oasis Church; and C.B. Nagel of Cru, formerly Campus Crusade for Christ International.Before leading a prayer for leadership, Siaw challenged attendees to reflect on their reason for attending the breakfast and reminded them that \"true leadership is to become the servant of all,\" after the example of Jesus Christ.The Rev. Christian Jensen of Denton has been chaplain of the Maryland General Assembly for 23 years and attended the first Easton Mayor's Prayer Breakfast and \"most of the intervening 40,\" he said.He is also the Maryland representative for the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C.\"It's a blessing to see an important tradition like this carry on through, regardless of what changes there are in political administration,\" Jensen said. \"To see something like this continue on is a good reflection on everyone's ability to get along with one another and understand what's important.\" \n \n Caption: CONNIE CONNOLLY/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nFrom left, Easton Mayor Megan Cook, the Rev.

    "content": "Trump steps up push for federal defunding of NPR, PBS\n\n March 28, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: MIKE SUNNUCKS APG Media | Section: News \n \n 1051\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n U.S. President Donald Trump is intensifying his push to eliminate federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations.\"NPR and PBS, two horrible and completely biased platforms (Networks!), should be DEFUNDED by Congress, IMMEDIATELY,\" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform Thursday.\n\"Republicans, don't miss this opportunity to rid our Country of this giant SCAM, both being arms of the Radical Left Democrat Party. JUST SAY NO AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!,\" Trump said.\nEarlier this week, Trump also said from the Oval Office he backed eliminating federal funding for public media.\nCongressional Republicans are looking at funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund PBS and NPR stations nationwide.\nCPB received $535 million in the most recent annual federal budget. The nonprofit was created by Congress in 1967.\n\"Reducing or eliminating CBP funding would save the federal government little (maximum of $535 million) while having dire though not universally fatal consequences for public broadcasting,\" said Michael Montgomery, a political scientist and professor at the University of Michigan-Dearborn.\nMontgomery contends the funding elimination push from Trump and conservatives is about their objections to what they see as NPR's and PBS' liberal slants.\n\"Make no mistake, if it happens, killing CPB will not be about saving money - this is about quieting voices and content that those on the right find objectionable or inconvenient,\" Montgomery said.\nSome of Trump's most ardent supporters in the GOP-controlled Congress also want to eliminate government money for public media.\n\"We will defund NPR and PBS!!,\" said U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, in a social media statement responding to Trump. \"The American people will NOT pay for disgusting Democrat propaganda anymore!!.\"\nGreene is critical of PBS' coverage of LGBTQ communities, including saying at a congressional hearing Wednesday that it promotes a \"trans agenda\" pointing to a local affiliate's airing of a segment featuring drag artists.\nDuring the same hearing on CPB funding Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, grilled NPR President CEO Katherine Maher about her progressive social media posts on white supremacy, reparations and civil unrest in 2020 and 2021.\nMaher became NPR boss in 2024.\nShe said her views have evolved, that NPR was working to offer a wider variety of perspectives in its coverage and had created new protocols to avoid bias, stressing the need for editorial independence.\nMaher also stressed the need for public media in rural and lower-income communities.\n\"Public radio is very often the only news service in places where market economics does not support the expense of local news,\" she told the House panel.\nMontgomery said NPR gets approximately 1% of its funding from CPB compared to roughly 14% for PBS.\n\"At the local level, an end of CPB funding would hit public TV harder than radio but public broadcasters of both types are likely to cut back, consolidate, or go silent,\" he said.\nPublic TV and radio stations and programs they produce would have to backfill any lost federal funding with money from other sources including donors, foundations and corporations.\nRick Ellis, founder and managing editor of Minnesota-based AllYourScreens.com (which tracks media news and industries), said defunding has been a desire of conservatives who either don't like government money for media outlets or \"what they consider to be liberal programming.\"\n\"They haven't been able to eliminate the spending in the past in large part because the areas that would be most impacted by the cuts are rural areas that are also Republican strongholds. And overall, government financing for public media is pretty popular with voters,\" he said.\nEllis points to a Pew Research Center poll released Wednesday showing 24% of respondents favor nixing government funding for PBS and NPR, while 43% support public media funding and 33% are not sure.\n\"In theory, it would probably be politically less complicated for public media to move away from government funding. But while it is overall a small slice of public media financing, it's tough to replace any other way,\" Ellis said.\nHe said larger public media outlets in bigger, more affluent cities will survive the funding loss.\n\"But it would be enough of a loss to decimate outlets in Alaska, Hawaii and a number of Midwestern and Southern states, which are smaller and already struggle to get funding from foundations, viewers and listeners,\" Ellis said.\nA number of local and statewide NPR and PBS stations have not yet responded to requests for comments about defunding and how they might navigate a new financial landscape, including their ties to universities and community colleges (which are also under fire from Trump).\nThe Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 has called for defunding CPB in its austerity blueprints, citing liberal biases and questioning the necessity of government outlays.\nElon Musk, who owns the X social media platform and runs Trump's Department of Government Efficiency efforts, has also echoed conservative calls to defund public media, in particular NPR. Trump said earlier this week DOGE efforts could also target public media funding.\nIrina Tsukerman, president of New York-based Scarab Rising Inc. (a geopolitical consulting firm) said funding cuts could result in public media jobs cuts, less local programming and potentially station closures.\nShe also sees wider media impacts.\n\"Public media plays a unique role in the media ecosystem, providing high-quality, in-depth journalism that is free from the commercial pressures faced by corporate media,\" Tsukerman said, pointing to investigative, cultural and educational content that might not be pursued by other outlets.\n'The removal of federal funding would push these stations to rely more heavily on private donations and corporate sponsorships, potentially influencing editorial independence and leading to content shifts that prioritize profitability over public service,\" she said.\nTrump and his populist backers are vehement critics of many traditional media outlets, accusing them of liberal bias.\nTrump routinely calls journalists \"enemies of the state,\" frequently characterizing critical coverage of himself and his administration as fabricated or \"witch hunts.\"\nA number of major U.S. media outlets and social media platforms are owned by conglomerates such as the Fox Corp. and Walt Disney Co. or some of the wealthiest persons in the world such as Musk, Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos and Meta/Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.\nThe latter trio were all front and center at Trump's inauguration in January inside the U.S. Capitol.\n\"A weakened public media sector benefits those who prefer a media environment dominated by private interests, where corporate-backed outlets and partisan networks can exert greater influence over public discourse,\" Tsukerman said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Victoria Gomez Lozano, deputy director for Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, said the theme for this year is \"Ser Hispano, es Ser Valiente,\" which translates to \"Being Hispanic is Being Brave.\"\nThe top three posters win prizes, and the first place poster will be used as the official poster for the 2025 Hispanic Heritage Month in Easton.\nRoxana Tapia, judge of the competition, said the first, second and third place winners this year came from various ages and ethnicities. But they all had the common goal of celebrating Hispanic heritage.\n\"You don't even have to be a Latina in order to participate,\" Tapia said. \"What I liked about this year is that we have people from all ethnicities. So if for any kids, I invite them to come over and participate, it's always fun. (Artists) should be proud of their work.\"\nThe winners of this year's competition were Piper Hambleton and Ellis Williams for their collaborative work. Their poster portrayed a large tree with flags from every Latin American and Hispanic country attached to its branches.\nAlberto Gamez, a judge and ChesMRC board member, called the colorful art piece \"The Tree of the Nations.\"\n\"I love that it was like a tree of life, but each branch had a different nation, and they covered a lot of them. So I love that it included everybody,\" Gamez said.\nGamez said he enjoyed all the art submitted this year and the various stories attached to the works, including third place winner Ahias Murillo, whose portrait \"I Paint My Own Reality\" showed Frida Khalo with an array of Latin American flags behind her. According to Gamez, the piece spoke on the identity and growth of Latinos.\nThe second place winner Majo Arrivillaga, whose portrait of two faceless individuals was meant to depict the different faces migrants have while traveling to the United States, also included a colorful landscape of Guatemala.\nArrivillaga said she loves drawing because it allows her to show people the beauty within the Latino community and encourages Latino artists of all ages to take the leap and share their work with their community.\n\"Being Hispanic, for me, is being a person who works, studies and centers their family,\" Arrivillaga said. \"We are multifaceted and we can do it all. That's what makes us brave.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

It isn't his first cross-country bike ride.In 2023, Kessinger biked from Baltimore to San Francisco in 70 days.\nKessinger's motivation for biking across the country came from a book called \"The Happiness of Pursuit\" by Chris Guillebeau.\n\"I kind of initially had an idea to do some sort of long-distance bike ride and specifically bike across the country after reading a book,\" Kessinger said. \"... It just sort of inspired me to think about doing something kind of crazy in the eyes of the most people or embarking on some sort of adventure or just exploring more.\"\nShortly after reading the book, Kessinger learned about the Ulman Foundation, a company the specializes in supporting young adults with cancer. The foundation participates in holds a bike-riding fundraiser, and Kessinger signed up.\nThe group raised $161,828 during their 2023 ride to San Francisco. Kessigner raised $7,431.\nWith new hopes on the horizon and used biking gear, Kessinger's sets his eyes on biking from Easton to Montreal, Canada this summer.\nAlthough Kessinger will not be raising funds during this ride, his friend Keisuke \"Jima\" Nakajima, who will be joining Kessinger from Baltimore to Montreal, is raising funds for the Ulman Foundation.\nNakajima then will take transportation back to Baltimore from Montreal, leaving Kessinger by himself for the grueling bike home.\n\"The decision to go from my home in Easton to Canada is sort of born out of like being able to go somewhere that I've never been and do it all under my own power,\" Kessinger said.\nDuring Kessinger's trip in 2023, the other bikers on the trip had built relationships in the past to find places for the group to stay the night. They also had help from the foundation.\nBut for his trip this summer, Kessinger plans to coordinate sleeping arrangements, showering and food through meeting new people and an app called Warm Showers.\n\"It's specifically for cycle tourists, so people doing long-distance bike rides, and you can make an account, and you can be a host on there. And so you can connect with these hosts who are all over all over the world,\" Kessinger said.\nKessinger's job as a dog sitter, gave him opportunity to train for the grueling bike ride. He biked from client to client. Kessinger established a savings with money from high school work and an internship after he graduated from the University of Maryland.\nKessinger's message to anyone scared of taking on new opportunities or trying something different is to just \"give it a go.\"\n\"Try it,\" Kessinger said. \"Say say when all of those reasons come up of why you know this can't work or you shouldn't do it. Just see what it feels like to ignore those and what it feels like to to say yes, because you'll figure out the rest later.\"\nTo follow along with Kessinger, follow is his blog at teamtahoe.substack.com/.\n. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

According to his daughter, Clarissa Fuentes Diaz, Espinal was arrested by ICE agents early Monday morning after stopping by Lowe's to pick up material for a job site.\n\"He didn't see anything suspicious. He put the material in the car, but then when he went to McDonald's to get something for breakfast, he saw a car behind him that looked kind of weird,\" Cordero said.\nICE agents followed Espinal to the Easton pool, ultimately arresting him on Route 322. He was taken to the Salisbury holding center. \"He preached to them all the way to Salisbury,\" Diaz said.\nFrom 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., Espinal's family had no clue of his whereabouts. \"We were about to do a report on a missing person because we didn't find out until almost 12:30,\" Diaz said.\nDiaz said Espinal had no criminal record.\nSince President Donald Trump took office in January, immigration arrests have doubled in the state of Maryland. More than 600 immigrants arrested during this time had no former criminal charges, according to the Deportation Data Project.\nEspinal has three children and a large extended family that he cares for, Diaz said. Tred Avon Strategies principal Len Foxwell referred to him as a pillar of the community.\nEarlier this month, Espinal spoke at Foxwell's son Darren's funeral. Diaz said Darren and her brother were best friends and his death has been hard on Espinal and the family.\nDiaz said she has received over 10 character letters on her father's behalf since his arrest yesterday morning, including one from Foxwell.\n\"It wasn't until I got to know him, however, that I saw how he honors and embodies the values of Christ in every aspect of his life,\" Foxwell wrote in a letter to ICE.\nEspinal's family has tried obtaining citizenship legally for years, but due to backlogs and expenses, Espinal remained undocumented, Diaz said.\n\"He's contributing to this country, and we're just trying to do it the right way,\" Diaz said. \"You know, unfortunately, with everything going on, everyone's a criminal apparently, but we're just hoping for the best and just to get him out of there.\"\nDiaz said each phone call Espinal makes from the detention center costs $50 for a 20-minute call and bond amounts for release currently range from $10,000 to $15,000.\n\"I've heard stories that people say, 'But why didn't you do it the legal way? Why aren't you doing it the legal way?' It's not easy,\" Diaz said. \"You know, if you're not in that person's shoes, you shouldn't be judging, and you shouldn't be criticizing.\"\nEspinal's family is relying on their faith and are hopeful that he will return home.\nICE could not be reached via phone to comment on this incident. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Salt truck crews work to keep ice at bay and local businesses open\n\n January 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: TOM MCCALL | Section: Local News \n \n 517\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Up before dawn, the team came with pallets of salt, ready to get their jobs done and help local businesses stay open, despite icy weather.Darrell Doupnik, the owner of Greenshore, an Easton-based landscaping company, has been providing salt and snow plow services in the winter for 40 years.\nHe met with his crew Friday morning to discuss their strategy for keeping walkways and parking lots ice-free for the company's roster of commercial clients.\nSome members of the team, like foreman Jerry Widener, have years of experience with winter weather.\n\"I have been doing this for 15 years,\" Widener said. \"I got up at 5 this morning. It's no big deal. I am used to it.\"\n\"In the winter we are clearing snow. When it snows, we are out here pushing snow. I am a pushing guy today, but I will do whatever it takes,\" he said.\nAccording to Widener, Friday's temperatures, though frigid, were high enough to keep the workload manageable for the team.\n\"If it gets too cold, the salt doesn't work,\" Widener said. \"I am the foreman today. I have five guys working for me. But for this, today, it is not too cold, and the salt works well.\"\nRock salt, lots of it, gets put in a spreader, which is attached to the back of a pickup truck for crews to drive around clients' roads and parking lots.\nDoupnik said the team used over 100 40-pound bags of salt to handle Friday's workload, purchased from Site One landscaping supply.\n\"It is not cheap. Salt costs $450 a ton,\" he said. \"We get them in 40-pound bags. You can put six bags at a time in the tailgate salt spreader.\"\nFriday's storm brought upwards of three inches of snow to Easton and upwards of four inches to the town's north and east, according to the National Weather Service.\nIn more intense winter weather, Doupnik said, the team requires even larger quantities of salt, and staying ahead of the icy roads can be a strain on their bodies.\n\"This (storm) is a piece of cake. It is not really blowing. The six- to 10-inchers, you are out for two days. It sucks. You go home and try to get some rest, and then you are back out fixing it up. You just go back out there,\" he said.\nIn his 40 years of plowing snow, Doupnik has learned the value his team's hard work provides to not only his customers, but to the community as a whole.\n\"For commercial clients, you kind of have to provide it. They like an all-inclusive package,\" he said. \"We do a lot of banks, we do these private schools and the churches. People still go to church. People still bank, and they have got to go to school. These places have to be open — especially the banks. We were out early this morning getting the banks opened up. Since schools are out, we do them last.\"\nDoupnik said the community often shows appreciation for what his crew does.\n\"My guys get treated very well. My customers give them stuff a lot — especially at Christmas time,\" he said. \"These are good guys, hard workers.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Songs about the water - Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum continues Changing Chesapeake series\n\n September 15, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Page: 1 | Section: News \n \n 703\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST. MICHAELS - Back in the early 1990s, Peter Panyon was taking part in a weeklong workshop for college professors focused on the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries when inspiration struck while cruising the Patuxent River.\"It occurred to me: Wait a minute, there's a story to tell here,\" Panyon remembered.\"I was thinking, 'Man, somebody should write a song about that, and nobody's going to do it if it's not me.'\" A biology professor by trade, Panyon would write and re-write the song over the years on the way to perfecting \"Can't Work the River.\" The ballad tracing a watermen's struggles was included on his band Big Tribe's debut album in 2014, and its music video is now part of the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum's special exhibition The Changing Chesapeake.At 7 p.m. on Sept. 28, Panyon and his Big Tribe bandmates Bonnie Eyler and Joe Huette will present \"Songs About the Water,\" an evening of songs and stories with a dose of science at the museum's Van Lennep Auditorium.This \"Changing Chesapeake Coffeehouse\" concert will feature fare provided by Blue Heron Coffee of St. Michaels and highlight songs drawing inspiration from local rivers to the Gulf oil spill and hurricane disasters.The suggested ticket price is $15 per participant for this event, which is sponsored by the Upper Shore Regional Folklife Center. To register and get more information, visit cbmm.org/SongsAboutWater.Panyon has married two of his passions in coming up with a catalog to fill a concert like this.The Calvert County resident is now retired after a lengthy career teaching biology at the University of Maryland, Catholic University and Prince George's Community College.As a musician, Panyon has written hundreds of songs, dating back to his teenage years. Recently, he's catalyzed Big Tribe, which has released two albums of eclectic rock tracks with a new one, \"Postcards from the Mission,\" due out later this year.Those experiences have helped Panyon carve out a unique lane as a songwriter with something to say.\"Your normal rock and roll about cars and girls, that's not what we do,\" Panyon said. \"What we're really up to is trying to hit people with music that, while they're having fun with it, there's a message in there that hopefully we get them to think about.\" The \"Can't Work the River\" video debuted in 2016 at a conference on teaching science through alternative media at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.Now, the 5-minute, 25-second video that features two watermen from different generations grappling with the realities of working the Patuxent River is finding a new audience as part of The Changing Chesapeake, which is on exhibit through next March.\"I want to at least crack open the door that leads to thinking about this scientifically,\" Panyon said. \"Yes, it's a story about a guy, and he lost his woman, and he's having trouble making a living, but when you dive beneath the surface of that story, there's this other story about what's actually going wrong. Why is this way of life that's millennia old getting more and more iffy?\" In concert, Panyon aims to expand on these important themes.While Big Tribe's albums feature big sound from a full band with bass drums, electric guitars, and an array of complementary instruments, its acoustic shows with Panyon, Eyler, and Huette are more easygoing, free-flowing, and even interactive.\"It's not just music,\" Panyon said. \"We're going to throw a little science in, and we're totally open to having a dialogue.\" The set list for these live shows goes in different directions with various meditations on the importance of valuing our waterways, including another track with roots in the 1990s and a literal earnestness to its title, \"We Are the River.\" As he prepares for his CBMM gig, Panyon is excited that he's found a perfect partner to help him share these songs that mean so much to him.\"Most bands are looking to play big venues like stadiums,\" Panyon said with a chuckle.\"For us, it's museums. We want to do as many museums as possible, and once we've conquered the museum world, then we're going for the stadiums.\" \n \n Caption: SUBMITTED\n \nChesapeake Bay Maritime Museum will welcome Peter Panyon and Big Tribe to campus on Thursday, Sept. 28, for \"Songs about the Water,\" an acoustic concert of songs and stories with a dose of science. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He spoke to real impacts of authoritarian governments of the past, but also to those currently taking hold, around the world and potentially, right here in America.\nLarry's thoughts, observations and quotes, particularly this one, from Trump, himself, \"I will be a dictator but only for a short time\" should give all Americans reason to carefully consider who steers Good Ship America in the upcoming four years.\nWe do not have to rely on what other people say about who, or what, Trump is; he, himself, tells everyone that tunes in to national media many opportunities to hear it, directly from his own mouth. Granted, there are many, many other media outlets and pundits that will spin who and what he is, and what he will do for you, if you vote to elect him. However, many of the promises he made during his first presidential run, were never fulfilled, for example:\nI'll build a great wall and Mexico will pay for it. NOPE.\nI'll repeal Obamacare and give you better, cheaper health care, NOPE.\nI'll bring manufacturing back to America, NOPE. Under his watch manufacturing jobs remained relatively flat, until they fell off the cliff as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nI'll grow the economy by 4% per year, NOPE. Actually, his best year was 2018, when the economy grew by 2.9% over the previous year.\nI'll cut taxes for everybody, NOPE. While many, but not all, benefited, marginally, from Trump's tax cuts, the vast majority went to the rich and to corporations, some of them not even American.\nI'll terminate Obama's executive orders on immigration, NOPE. While one program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, (DACA), was challenged in our courts, it remains in effect, yet today. A second program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), never was implemented, so Trump could not terminate it.\nIf you listen to Trump now, he is regurgitating some of the same promises he failed to fulfill during his first term in office, even though he enjoyed Republican majorities in both the U.S. House and the Senate for his first two years in office. Which brings me to a word, or two, of caution to those who choose to vote in the upcoming elections.\nBe careful of those who don't keep their promises and be careful of the would-be dictator you vote to elect; you don't always get the kind of dictator you think you will, when you voted, based on what he and his minions tell you, and it is very hard to get rid of dictators.\nWILLIAM C.

    "content": "'Heartbeat of Easton Utilities' legacy lives on\n\n January 25, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: JOHN ENGLEHART | Section: Columns \n \n 1208\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n On Jan. 13, Vicki Petro retired as vice president of human resources at Easton Utilities after 31 years of dedicated service. To some, this may seem like the closing chapter of just another HR career. But to those of us who had the privilege of calling Vicki a colleague, a mentor or a friend, this marks the end of an extraordinary era in the Mid-Shore community.Vicki began her journey with Easton Utilities on Nov. 2, 1993, as the organization's sole HR professional, reporting to the business manager. Over the past three decades, she has shaped the careers of countless employees, directly overseeing the hiring of 324 individuals during her tenure, guiding many through the retirement process and supporting the training and development of many more.\nShe's ensured payroll ran seamlessly more than 750 times, served as a trusted adviser to two CEOs and been the go-to resource for employees seeking guidance to navigate their careers. She has served as mentor to many at Easton Utilities and in the Mid-Shore community, having a profound impact on them both professionally and personally.\nI first met Vicki in 2021 when I interviewed for a position with another organization. She had been invited to serve on the interview panel to lend her expertise and help them make an informed decision. From the moment she spoke, I was struck by her professionalism, warmth and rare passion for HR — a field where such genuine excitement can sometimes feel scarce.\nI remember thinking, If I ever have the chance to work for her, I'll take it, because there's so much I could learn from someone like her. That opportunity came in 2023, and over the past two years, I've grown immensely—not just as an HR professional, but also as a leader and as a person—thanks to her guidance.\nEaston Utilities, like any organization, can be thought of as a living body. The linemen could be viewed as the muscles, the water/wastewater operators perhaps viewed as the backbone, the customer service representatives perhaps the face, and—if you ask the engineers, they might claim to be the brain. But at its core, Human Resources is the heart. It keeps the organization alive and thriving, circulating energy and support to every part.\nFor 30 years, Vicki was Easton Utilities' heartbeat, sustaining the organization through storms, challenges, and triumphs alike.\nHer impact reaches far beyond Easton Utilities' walls. If a gas technician safely resolved a leak in your home, it's likely Vicki played a role in hiring them. If a Velocity technician helped you as a rural customers get connected to much needed high speed internet, chances are Vicki was there to interview them. When linemen braved ice storms to restore power to your neighborhood, she likely contributed to their onboarding. And when you've interacted with our professional and compassionate customer service staff, you've experienced the result of Vicki's discerning eye for talent.\nIn sum, if you've been impressed with Easton Utilities' service over the past 30 years, it's because Vicki had a hand in it — not only by selecting individuals who embody Easton Utilities core values but also by shaping the training that helped them excel. She has also been a great mentor to others through her Leadership Maryland classmates, impacting professionals around the State of Maryland.\nVicki's influence wasn't confined to hiring or compliance—it was deeply human. She understood that when employees face challenges, they carry those burdens home to their families. Time and again, she offered them support, showing them how to navigate their struggles so they could be present for their loved ones.\nAs her retirement approached, Vicki demonstrated the same grace and foresight that defined her career. This graceful departure reminds me of a lesson from sports. As a Baltimore football fan, I think of the legendary Johnny Unitas. He was the greatest quarterback of all time, but even he struggled to hang up his cleats. In a twist few like to remember, Unitas ended his career not in Baltimore but in a San Diego Chargers uniform, a move that seemed out of place for such an icon. It's a lesson in knowing when it's time to step aside. Vicki, however, has shown impeccable timing. She embraced the evolving needs of the organization, mentored her successors, and made way for the next chapter—all while ensuring Easton Utilities' heart continues to beat strong. Some leaders struggle to step aside, holding onto their roles even as the times and needs of their organizations evolve. But not Vicki. She embraced the opportunity to mentor and prepare the next generation, ensuring Easton Utilities' heart continues to beat strong long after she steps away.\nOne of my favorite movies is The Dark Knight. A memorable quote from that movie is Harvey Dent's reflection on heroes: \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" In my years of observing HR leaders, I've seen this sentiment play out. Many HR Directors depart their roles amid controversy or burnout, others retiring from their organization leaving behind employees that are happy to see them go rather than admiration. But Vicki defied that trend. She is retiring on her own terms, as a universally respected leader—beloved by employees, admired by executives, and deeply respected throughout the mid-shore community.\nAfter Jan. 13, as the days, weeks, months and years go by, Vicki's name will be heard less and less around Talbot County and Easton Utilities. New employees will join, and those who knew her best will retire. The stories of the great things she achieved as the heart of Easton Utilities will fade, as the stories of legends often do. But I can guarantee her name will be spoken one more time, 20 years from now …\nWhen my time comes to retire, and I am the \"old-school\" HR director trying to understand the up-and-coming HR leaders looking to replace me, I'm sure I will observe them make some kind of mistake — fall flat on their face in a way that only experience can teach to avoid. And just like Vicki, I'll be there with some kind of sage advice to help them learn from it. When they ask me, \"Who taught you that?\" my answer will be simple: \"Vicki Petro taught me that.\"\nAnd with that the legend of Vicki Petro will continue.\nNo one asked or paid me to write this. I did so because some contributions deserve recognition, and Vicki's story is one of them. Over the past two years, I've had the honor of working with her and witnessing her remarkable leadership firsthand. Vicki has been an exceptional HR professional, a trusted advisor, a compassionate mentor, and an inspiring leader. She has not only shaped Easton Utilities but has left it stronger and better for the next generation in our mid-shore community.\nFor now, Vicki rides off into the sunset to begin the next chapter of a legendary life — as a grandma spending time with her grandbabies, traveling with her husband to new places across the globe and enjoying the fruits of her labor. And I'm sure in those new adventures, she will be the heartbeat of those moments, just as she has been the heartbeat for so many years at Easton Utilities and the Mid-Shore community.\nEnjoy your grandbabies, Vicki. Thank you for everything. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Some town councilmembers raised concerns over Lesher simultaneously serving on the County Council and utilities commission.\nTown officials said the legality of serving on both bodies would depend on if the utilities commission is considered a \"trust and profit\" office, since state law doesn't allow someone to hold two such positions.\nTown Attorney Sharon VanEmburgh said at the March 3 meeting that while the town \"would probably get to the conclusion that it is not a second office of trust and profit,\" it would be best to first review case law and attorney general rulings.\nThe appointment was made to fill the role of current commission member Buck Duncan. His time expires this May, leaving ample time for a new appointment, the mayor said. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Juvenile crime, reform are top issues for Talbot County police\n\n November 22, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 5 | Section: News \n \n 615\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - Talbot County is seeing increases in juvenile crime, along with upticks in petty thefts and some violent crimes, according to the county's top law enforcement officials.Updates on local crime trends from each law enforcement agency in the county dominated discussion at Talbot County's latest Police Accountability Board meeting on Tuesday, Nov. 14.Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble reported a 19% increase in calls for service and a 13% increase in reported crime handled by the sheriff's office, including some small increases in assaults and drug charges. Crimes relating to fraud of older residents are likely the biggest financial loss in the county, he added.Gamble identified juvenile crimes in schools as a particular issue for the sheriff's office, which has uniformed officers serving in most of the public schools.Recently implemented state juvenile justice reform laws have barred police from charging anyone under 13 with most crimes.Gamble said Easton High School and Easton Middle School are where police see most of the incidents involving children, and over 30% of this year's reported incidents involve children under 13.\"We have 12-year-olds that are punching other kids in the face time and time again in the schools, or assaulting other kids, and there's no services for them,\" he said.Police Accountability Board members acknowledged the concerns, asking what officers can do to better handle issues with youth under 13 and if police can work with the schools.Gamble said the school system doesn't have leverage to handle discipline other than resorting to suspensions.Looking forward, Gamble hopes to see movement within state leadership in Annapolis during the upcoming General Assembly session to push legislation to tackle issues with the juvenile reform laws.Outside of juvenile crime, those at the meeting discussed several recent local incidents.In Easton, two homicides occurred within town limits in the last few months - one on Blake Street in early August and a second at the Sidetracked Saloon in late September.Several thefts and robberies have also occurred in town, said Easton Police Chief Alan Lowrey. Those include a series of burglaries at vape stores where individuals are seeking Delta-8 THC cartridges, a non-regulated and legal psychoactive substance with effects similar to recreational cannabis.Another issue of great concern to Easton residents is crime on the Rails to Trails pathways throughout town, Lowrey said, citing a serious assault on the trails in the summer.To alleviate those concerns, the town's police department is increasing patrols on the trails and issuing more citations, Lowrey said. Those efforts include repopulating the department's bike unit, which is down due to lower staffing levels.In St. Michaels, Police Chief Jeffrey Oswald didn't note any specific crime trends, though he did mention two car thefts, which are \"extremely unusual\" for the town, he said. The town's tourist season is coming to a close, which means St. Michaels will have a lower population and more shops closed up for the winter.The small St. Michaels Police Department is down a few officers, though two new officers are starting soon, Oswald said. The department was also able to secure higher starting salaries and increases for current officers.\"Things are looking up. It's just going to be a little while,\" he said.Oxford Police Chief Eric Kellner did not report any major issues, adding that Oxford is a \"very safe little town.\" The town's three-member police department was fully staffed until a few weeks ago, but Oxford's town commissioners recently agreed to increase the department to four full-time officers, Kellner said. The town is now looking to hire one additional officer. \n \n Caption: NATALIE JONES/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nMembers of the Talbot County Police Accountability Board, seated to the right, listen to the county's top law enforcement officials during a Nov. 14 meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Vision from the beginning': BAAM leaders excited for new academic center\n\n December 14, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 559\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — The tall, welcoming windows in the classrooms of Building African American Minds Inc.'s new academic center in Easton don't just bring in sunlight. They connect the surrounding residents to new opportunities.Three stories high and nearly 25,000 square feet, the center will house classes, tutoring, youth programs, community gatherings and more. It sits on Jowite Street, next to the BAAM Athletic Center and across from a large residential area.\nJames Bell, director of instruction, academic support and community wellbeing for the nonprofit, believes the space fits within the organization's mission of creating an educational and social space for underserved children in the area.\n\"The excitement really is looking out of the windows and seeing the potential,\" Bell says. \"So when you see the community, out of every window here in the facility, it lets you know that it's an opportunity for them as well.\"\nSaturday, Building African American Minds will cut the ribbon on the academic center, which is expected to be up and running in January. The center will allow the nonprofit to significantly expand how many children it serves in after-school and summer enrichment programs.\nThere is a library, media center and multipurpose dining room on the first floor. Above are eight classrooms, as well as speciality rooms for esports, art and music.\nClassrooms are designed with desks situated for full-group, small-group and individual learning.\nDina Daly, executive director of Building African American Minds, pointed out a wellness wing, which will be a private space for health, counseling and more. She added that BAAM's sister agency, private school Polaris Village Academy, will operate out of the academic center in 2025.\nWhile the organization's focus has been serving under-resourced youth in the nearby neighborhoods, its reach isn't limited to children or Talbot County residents, Daly says.\nAdult workforce programs will be hosted in the new academic center during the day. On the third floor, Chesapeake College will begin hosting GED and English second language classes in February.\n\"We had a vision from the beginning,\" Daly said. \"So we're just following up on our vision for what we thought needed to happen, not just for the youth.\"\nIn its 20th year, Building African American Minds has long hoped for an academic center like the one that sits on Jowite Street today. Its previous hub, the athletic center next to the new building, isn't going anywhere either.\nHowever, the new academic center was about a $10 million project, Daly said, more than double what the athletic center cost. Private donors, community donations, and state and federal funding made it possible.\n\"We build for the future,\" Daly said. \"From the inception of BAAM, we always talked about building a school and academic center. It's more than a school now. It's more like a community center, really.\"\nDaly said it's been a long process, but she knows the wait was worth it. Starting small and meeting a select group's needs instead of going too broad, such as when the organization began as a boys-only nonprofit in 2005, was the path to success.\nReflecting on the fact that a 20-year goal is finally coming to fruition, Daly hopes the journey of Building African American Minds can inspire others to start small and dream big.\n\"That's why I tell people, 'don't give up on your dreams,'\" Daly said. \"Make smaller goals, make them achievable, and then just keep building it up. And look at what we've accomplished.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

I often rely on this option, especially when we have last-minute guests. It's impressive to quickly produce a high-quality, delicious pizza; it's my little secret.READY TO ROLLThe takeout pizza store in my neighborhood sells ready-to-roll pizza dough.I can buy a large ball of dough for $3.50, which makes a 16-inch pizza.Not all pizza stores sell their dough (the national chains in my area look at me as if I have three eyes when I inquire), but independent shops are typically more than happy for the business - any business.In fact, one store near me even lists this on their menu board.READY TO GOMy local supermarket sells ready-to-bake pizza dough in the deli section for $3.49 (enough to make one 12-inch pizza).Now is the time to start planning how to replace a regular meal more economically.You're smart, so I am confident you will come up with ideas and strategies I haven't considered.YOUR TURNThese are only a few ideas for combining quick-service foods with home cooking to create semi-homemade meals.What are your favorite tricks and tips?

Unfortunately, this \"new\" resolution is nothing more than a repackaging of the same resolutions we have watched the county wrestle with for more than a year with no outcome in sight.Changing a few numbers and giving it a new title does not in any way change the obvious intent of all this legislation, which is to keep the Lakeside development under the control of a minority group with their own agenda. What that agenda is has been unclear but obviously their intent is to drag out the process in any way they can to buy time for more interference.\nA recent letter to the Star Democrat went so far as to imply that the Town of Trappe needs to be ready to build schools for the new students from Lakeside. Since when did small towns begin building and paying for their own schools? Isn't that a county function? I thought that's what we pay county taxes for?\nThe implication was that citizens in Talbot County shouldn't have to educate Trappe children. Does that mean Trappe taxpayers shouldn't pay for schools in other parts of the county? That is not how government works. What next? Does Trappe need to build it's own hospital?\nI have paid county taxes for the 25 years since retiring here. I would like to know what my taxes go for. I see many expenditures approved at County Council meetings using funds that include my taxes. Why should I feel guilty when I expect to be treated like any other county citizen?\nThe Lakeside development is simply Trappe's attempt to make up for years of lackluster or nonexistent growth so that our town can enjoy a tax base that can provide the funding needed to function as a modern, financially stable municipality. The county also will benefit in the long run with additional residential and commercial taxes, more housing for county residents, not to mention jobs to reduce unemployment in the area.\nWhy doesn't anyone want to look at the positives of a planned development instead of focusing on the negatives? This whole situation has dragged out long enough and doesn't need new legislative smoke and mirrors in an attempt to drag it further. All of this waste of time and resources is an unnecessary cost we should not be forced to bear.\nAnd on a final note, I really want to express my disbelief that Mr. Lesher and Ms. Melkie would insult the intelligence of their constituents by their attempt to blatantly force their old legislation through as something new, just by making such a minute change, which will only add one to three years more to an already time-consuming process.\nMICHAEL SULLIVAN\nTrappe \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "It's time for Mid-Shore regional planning\n\n June 9, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Activate \n \n 588\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Recently, the Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC) released a new 10-year strategic plan calling for (in their words), a \"sea change,\" to boost economic opportunity in Baltimore city and five Maryland counties adjacent to Baltimore — Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard.Founded in 1955, GBC is a not-for-profit organization with approximately 400 members.\nTheir membership includes large, mid-size and small businesses, not-for-profit organizations, foundations, educational providers and health care institutions in the Baltimore region.\nAll the geographic areas served by GBC are unique, but all recognize the value of mutually beneficial collaborative efforts on economic development matters.\nIn an ever-changing world, GBC 's new strategic plan acknowledged a pressing need for changes on a better definition of their traditional purposes and their traditional goals.\nAccordingly, their new plan includes new purposes and new goals to guide private and public investment and regional collaborations designed to result in transformational positive change in the Baltimore region.\nSpecific GBC goals are included in three broad areas of economic development. They are:\nIndustry and innovation.Place and community.Talent and people.\nUltimately, GBC's vision is to position the Baltimore region's residents, businesses and quality of life amenities, as a globally recognizable and competitive brand.\nThe overall success of GBC's new plan is based not only on new purposes and new goals. It also depends upon on a continuing commitment to collaboration from businesses, political leaders, developers, educators, workforce providers, nonprofits, entrepreneurs, current economic development organizations and other key stakeholders in Baltimore City and the five surrounding counties.\nBased on past measurable successes with GBC, they understand they do best by not competing against each other but by working together to compete globally for current and emerging economic engines that provide good jobs, good wages, good benefits and economic stability.\nThey also understand the needs of the leaders such economic engines. These leaders are much less interested in artificial human-made geographic boundaries that delineate county and municipal borders and are much more interested in what a region can provide in terms of a long-term, reliable and positive business environment along with a supply of skilled workers.\nNo doubt any discussion of any changes leading to a new regional approach to economic development for the Mid-Shore region may be unsettling to some. It is new, and it is different.\nI suggest now is the time for the leaders in Talbot, Dorchester and Caroline counties (at a minimum) to immediately engage in meaningful discussions on the feasibility and benefits of launching a Mid-Shore version of a regional economic development organization comparable to the GBC.\nThe key words are comparable to the GBC, not identical to the GBC.\nI am not suggesting Mid-Shore leaders adopt GBC's purposes and goals without modifications that work best for the Mid-Shore now and going forward. I further suggest we already have an outstanding organization in place to serve as a new leader in regional economic development.\nThat organization is Chesapeake College.\nThe college has served the Mid Shore region with distinction since it was chartered as Maryland's first regional community college in 1965 and opened in 1967.\nOffering a wide range of adult learning opportunities, they have extensive experience in developing and conducting workforce-training programs. The availability of these programs is great selling point for economic development prospects.\nI also suggest that in addition to a new regional economic development organizational model, the Mid-Shore must have an open and transparent process for developing regional economic development goals based on citizen input to maintain and advance the Mid-Shore's position in Maryland as the \"Land of Pleasant Living.\"\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

There have been countless reports of selfless rescue and recovery efforts by first responders and volunteers, some from well beyond the immediate flooded area.\nThe worst has been numerous messages on social media and other media platforms — e.g., a newspaper editorial cartoon — that were vile, hateful and some of which were vulgar.\nMany of them chose to blame Trump supporters or policy decisions of the Trump administration for this tragedy.\nFar too many did not include expressions of sadness or sympathy for the deaths of innocent children and adults or compassion for the lifelong impact on all the flooding survivors.\nThe level of vitriol in these messages is so offensive, I will not repeat any of them in this column.\nThe only thing they have in common is they are devoid of any sense of decency and civility.\nSomewhat surprising has been dismay and even outrage expressed from unexpected sources over these vile messages.\nNina Turner is a former national co-chair for the Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign.\nShe recently said, \"It takes a serious lack of humanity to see children to be in a politicized discussion and respond something like lines of \"that's what they [voters in Texas] voted for.\"\nTurner's closing one word comment says it all — \"Shameful.\"\nJohn Favreau and Tommy Vietor are co-hosts on the left of center, Pod Save America.\nBoth worked for Barack Obama prior to and during his presidential administration.\nBoth have condemned social media posts that blame local Texans and the Trump administration for all who died as a result of the recent floods.\nFavreau said: \"I think the really gross stuff was, I saw some people be, like, 'Well, Texas, you voted for Trump, and this is what you get.'\"\nFavreau has challenged suggestions that staffing levels at the National Weather Service in Texas had anything to do with the tragedy. Favreau has said, \"It seems like the National Weather Service, like I said, did send out a timely warning, it just didn't get to people. And that's, you know, not the Trump administration saying that; independent meteorologists and experts have all said this.\"\nVietor has said that while questions about the effect of weather services cuts could be \"an important question going forward, I could have done without the, like, instant, you know, leap to blame name-your-political-opponent for this tragedy on Twitter.\"\nThe \"blame your political opponent\" campaign on this tragedy is already well underway.\nShortly after news broke on the flooding, Sen. Chuck Schumer demanded the Commerce Department's inspector general investigate vacancies at National Weather Service offices and whether the purported vacancies resulted in a higher death toll in in Texas.\nSchumer has suggested that proposed but yet-to-be-implemented Trump budget cuts resulted in unfilled weather service positions in Texas were to blame. Sen. Chris Dodd has said likewise.\nSchumer proclaimed: \"The American people deserve answers.\"\nYes, we do, but not from you two or anyone who wants to advance a political agenda from this tragedy.\nWe deserve answers only if the following investigative guidelines are agreed to, in advance of, and are strictly adhered to during every phase of any investigation. At a minimum, the investigation must focus less on assigning blame for what happened or did not happen with regard to timely and effective flash flood alerts.\nThe laser like focus must be on what can be done going forward to help ensure it never happens again.\nDiffering opinions must be welcome and considered provided they follow the timeless observation of former U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who once said, \"Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts.\"\nOne new previously unreported fact comes from a recent Washington Post article headline — \"Camp Mystic's leader got a 'life threatening' flood alert. They evacuated an hour later.\"\nWe also need to accept that we never have and never will live in a risk-free world.\nWe can only anticipate risks and take prudent steps to try to avoid them or deal with them if and when necessary. Accidents can never be totally avoided despite plans and best intentions.\nGoing forward, we desperately need a renewed universal commitment that when tragedies strike, to make sure social media posts and other public reactions reflect common decency and respect for each and every person impacted in any way by that tragedy.\nThis is especially vital in dealing with those who hold different political party affiliations or different views on a wide range of public policy issues.\nWe must do so if we have any hope of reversing the steadily declining levels of decency and civility in our society. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

With the help of scientists from abroad (immigrants like Einstein who spent the rest of his career as a physics professor at Princeton), the University of Chicago, Columbia, and Berkeley were major players in developing the atomic bomb that made us a superpower in the first place.\nNot only have our scientists given us satellite radio, smart phones and the internet, which we rely on in Talbot County, they have also given us missile shields, drones and other smart weapons. Future conflicts will be fought with high-tech systems — not yesterday's weapons — and we must keep up with their development.\nI can understand a certain amount of animosity toward the stereotype professor or scientist, but I can't understand why one would want to harm our research programs and universities, which are the envy of the world.

If so, you must do something to reduce the number. Today's deal features one such play technique.Against four spades, West led the club ace. When East signaled with the 10, West continued with the club king and a third club. East exited with the spade three: two, eight, king. How should South have continued?South's three-spade rebid was invitational. North, with the two top trump honors, had an automatic raise to game.With all of the side suits safe, declarer's only concern was the trump suit. If that was breaking 3-2, he would have no trouble, but what if East had started with four spades including the jack?(If West had jack-fourth, the contract was beyond resuscitation.) The only chance would be a trump coup. To reduce his trump length to the same as East's, South made the farsighted play of immediately cashing dummy's heart ace and ruffing a heart in his hand.After declarer had played a trump to dummy's ace, getting the bad news, he ruffed another heart in his hand. Then South cashed his three diamond tricks, ending in the dummy. Luckily, East had to follow suit throughout.South was left with the Q-10 in spades, and East had the J-5. When South called for a heart, East's apparent trump trick disappeared in a textbook trump coup.©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

He's been bringing his wildlife sculptures to the Waterfowl Festival for around a decade.The South Dakota couple was stationed inside of the Waterfowl's main building for the Art at the Armory display. Directly across sat Carol Heiman-Greene and her husband, all the way from Orange, California.\nThe two artists and their respective spouses aren't just acquaintances. They're friends, or better yet, family.\n\"I come back year after year, and these are like my families,\" Heiman-Greene said of the fellow artists she's come to know. Kara Green used that exact same word — family — to describe her and her husband's friendship with the Heiman-Greenes and others.\nCarol Heiman-Greene, who's been an exhibitor at the Easton festival for about 20 years, says there's a \"core\" of artists who have been at Waterfowl and other festivals for a long time. She said when new artists come, it's a joy to welcome them into the family, too.\nOn Saturday, Heiman-Greene pointed out her painting of a California condor vulture, laughing since Jim Green had a sculpture of a California condor for sale.\nThrough the ups and downs of travel, sales and weather, Heiman-Greene said artists have \"all sorts of tales (they) can share\" with one another.\n\"You come to these (festivals), and you see your friends from last year and years previous,\" Jim Green said. \"It's so nice to connect with people.\"\nGreen says he loves those friendships with fellow artists not just for the relationships, but also to expand his work in an environment rich with creative ideas.\n\"You have a tendency to think of the world as built on artists when you come to these, because you see so many of them,\" he continued. \"And then you get home and you're in this desert of nobody else around you that does this. So it's really nice to have that creativity, that creative aspect of things to bounce ideas off of other people.\"\nFor the Green couple, it's not a competitive environment. Last year, Jim Green said someone stopped by to let him know they recreated his raven coat rack sculpture.\n\"I know there are other artists that would kind of take that the wrong way,\" he said. \"But I was like, 'Yeah, where are the pictures? I love that.'\"\nBoth Carol Heiman-Greene and Jim Green said the people, atmosphere and weather at Waterfowl combine to make the festival one of their favorites. While Green said his sales are typically solid at Waterfowl, even if they weren't, the three-day event is still his \"favorite one of the year.\"\n\"I love coming here to see the atmosphere and everything there is about Maryland,\" Heiman-Greene said. \"It's really fun. It has such a small-town atmosphere.\"\nDespite living states and plane rides apart, the annual Waterfowl Festival tradition has helped bring the Greens and Heiman-Greenes together as artists and friends. It's a trend Jim Green hopes continues for years to come.\n\"Art sells art,\" Jim Green said. \"If you can't have all boats rise, you shouldn't be in the boat.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Drivers need patience on roadways\n\n September 13, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Staff Writer | Section: Editors Inbox \n \n 428\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n As a senior driver of 70 years driving experience I have finally reached my frustration point in what I (correctly or incorrectly) perceive as unwarranted impatience, if not absolute rudeness and discourtesy, on the part of drivers in Talbot County.I am a competent, not perfect, operator of a motor vehicle, and I do not understand the needs of many other drivers, younger ones in particular, to honk their horns, pass on the right side, ride your bumper or even pass on a double line when I take a needed extra second or two to double check when I am making a turn, entering an intersection, leaving a stop light, or driving at what I consider a safe 40 mph on the narrow, winding and crowned blacktop roads here, many of which have no shoulders only ditches.\nYou drivers who are speeding and tailgating in our county — and you, in my experience are many —will get where you are going without putting me or yourselves in danger. An absolutely unneeded honking horn is startling and rather than achieving its likely objective of hurrying me along and making me drive in the manner in which you think I should be driving actually slows me down when I look once more to reassess the situation around me before I move away from that light or stop sign or turn against traffic.\nYou will be senior drivers someday yourself, and you will understand certain facts — namely your reaction time slows a touch, your hearing and vision, though adequate for the task, are not what they used to be and your trust in your own cognition in discerning what is happening around you is quite naturally slightly diminished.\nTalbot County and the town of Easton today present challenging driving conditions. The sheer volume of traffic, the narrow streets in town with double parking, and the plethora of large sized pickups and SUVs plying streets and roadways here that were not designed for these types of vehicles are factors, as well as the presence of some dangerous intersections lacking traffic controls — one of these is one I use daily, the intersection of the Parkway and Tristan Drive. I do not need an accident at my age, whether my fault or not. This is a major reason I (and many others of my age) need that extra moment of time to cope safely and competently with the driving situations already mentioned. And I can cope if I get just a minimum amount of cooperation from all of you others on the road.\nJOEL S.

I'm just haunted by that team.\"\nMason Kaplan netted a hat trick and helped set up both of Casey Burkom's goals Friday, as the Crusaders defeated the Sabres, 5-2, at the Talbot Community Center to clinch the second seed in next week's Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association B Conference playoffs.\nSt. Paul's (6-2-1) is scheduled to host third-seeded Sts. Peter & Paul (5-3-2) on Monday at 4 p.m. in an MIAA B semifinal at the Patterson Park Ice Rink in Baltimore.\n\"This has been a really fun season,\" Gerdano said. \"We have a really young team. We have 11 freshmen out of 22 rostered. So it's not surprising that maybe they're lacking confidence at times.\"\nThe Crusaders controlled the neutral zone through the first period, and put half a dozen shots on goalie Maddie Maloney in the opening 3 minutes.\n\"It's exactly what we were asking for; a fast start,\" St. Paul's head coach Sean Baker said. \"We wanted to get pucks behind their D, play down in their end at the beginning of the game to set the tone early.\"\nDespite that dominance, Maloney (25 saves) didn't let anything past her until 3 minutes, 24 seconds remained in opening period, when Andrew Breslin and Burkom set up Kaplan's first goal.\nSt. Paul's extended that lead to 2-0 just 38 seconds into the second period, when Kaplan fed Burkom, who slipped the puck inside the left post.\n\"Goals in the first minute of the period and the last minute of the period are always big,\" Baker said. \"You want to keep momentum for the beginning of the period and the end of the period. It's something that we talk about; first and last minute. We want to be the ones that score. We don't want to give anything up.\"\nThe Sabres cut their deficit to 2-1 with 3:44 left, as Drew Watson scored off a dish from Mason Roland. Sts. Peter & Paul went on the power play a little over a minute later, but put little pressure on St. Paul's goalie Andrew Dugas (13 saves). The Crusaders killed off the 2-minute minor. then immediately restored their two-goal cushion, as Kaplan — the MIAA B's goal-scoring leader with 21 — scored off Burkom's assist with 30.2 seconds left in the period.\n\"Obviously that's a big momentum shift, Gerdano said. \"You cut the lead in half and they get one right back. That's a little bit of a gut punch. But it's a long game and we're always telling our players you just got to keep fighting to the end.\"\nSt. Paul's widened its lead to 4-1 with 1:53 elapsed in the third, as Kaplan and Nigel Wilson-Phillippi set up Burkom's second goal. That lead ballooned to 5-1 with 8:32 remaining, when Brendan Townsend and Burkom connected passes to set up Kaplan in the slot for his third goal.\n\"We seem to be peaking at the right time,\" said Baker, whose team has won three straight. \"We're looking pretty good right now.\"\nAfter a brief skirmish with a little under 7 minutes remaining left the Crusaders down a man, Sts. Peter & Paul's Buel Jenson scored unassisted with 6:45 to play. But the Sabres couldn't cut any further into their deficit.\n\"We absolutely came out flat,\" Gerdano said. \"We were throwing the puck away like crazy. I think we were a little afraid to have the puck on our stick, not quite confident enough with the puck. A little uncharacteristic and it's something we can improve on going into next week. If we find that confidence and find good energy we can absolutely take it to that team.\n\"When they have that confidence you can tell, and we're really hard to play against,\" added Gerdano, whose team tied St. Paul's 2-2 earlier this season. \"We have great goaltending. We're hard to score on and we got great defense. We just need to find ways to score. And if we do that we're going to be really hard to beat against anybody. We have the recipe.\"\nNote: The Sabres have tied St. Paul's three times under Gerdano's direction. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "An age in America comes to an end\n\n May 2, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: BILL PEAK Talbot County Free Library | Section: Columns \n \n 890\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n The small town of Oroville, California, drifted into the 20th century as a shadow of its former self.Back in 1848, when gold was discovered in the area, prospectors had poured into the place. But by 1900 the vein had long since petered out, and the town had become little more than an agricultural backwater.\nMeanwhile, the modern world marched on. In Los Angeles, California's first movie theater opened for business in 1902. The next year, the Wright brothers made the first heavier-than air flight at Kitty Hawk. And in 1908, Henry Ford brought the automobile within reach of everyday Americans when he introduced the reliable, relatively inexpensive Model T.\nStill, news of these wonders would have arrived in Oroville as little more than rumors of a wider, more sophisticated world.\nThen, on Aug. 29, 1911, a teenaged layabout named Floyd Hefner strode into the corral of the local slaughterhouse, intending to hitch up a team of horses, and found a nearly naked man leaning unsteadily against a fence-post. The last living member of a Native American tribe had come in from the cold.\nPerhaps not surprisingly for the time and place, guns were drawn, dogs were held at bay, and someone used the telephone in the slaughterhouse to call the law. By the time the sheriff arrived, a butcher's cloak had been thrown over the shoulders of the man, who spoke no language anyone understood. The sheriff handcuffed the man, drove him into town in a wagon (the first time in his life he'd ever ridden in a wheeled vehicle), and locked him up in the county jail.\nIt wasn't long before newspapers throughout the state were reporting the discovery of America's \"last wild Indian.\" Learning of the news, Alfred Kroeber, a renowned professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, sent a colleague, Thomas Waterman, up to Oroville.\nMeeting with the prisoner in his cell, Waterman thought he might be speaking a language related to the Yana tongue. Waterman knew a little Yana, and when he tried it out on the prisoner, the man's face lit up.\nFor the first time since the only other members of his Yahi band had died, he had heard another human being speak a word or two he understood.\nWaterman was able to ask the man his name. Using a combination of gestures and simple Yahi, the man explained that in his culture it was taboo to speak his name aloud to someone else until another member of his tribe had formally introduced him. As this was now impossible, Waterman ended up simply calling him \"Man\" in the Yahi tongue.\nAnd so it is that this Native American man comes down to us in history under the false name of \"Ishi.\" We will never know what his real name was.\nWaterman's fellow professor at Berkeley, Alfred Kroeber, was a remarkable man. He had earned his doctorate in 1901 from Columbia University, studying under Franz Boaz, the father of modern anthropology. Kroeber took Ishi in and gave him a place to live in the university's museum, where Ishi worked as a janitor. This allowed Kroeber and the other anthropologists in his department to study Ishi closely over the remaining five years of his life.\nYou might expect that much of what Kroeber and Waterman learned from Ishi would have been horrifying. This was a man who, from boyhood, watched his tribe and immediate family whittled down by ceaseless slaughter. Norman Kingsley, an eager participant in one of the last massacres, later recounted that, in the middle of his attack, he exchanged his .56 caliber Spencer rifle for a .38 caliber pistol, because the rifle \"tore them up so bad,\" especially the babies.\nBut after his introduction into modernizing California, accounts say Ishi didn't speak of the horrors he'd witnessed, nor did he give in to melancholy or despair. He adapted with grace to his new life and embraced many of the changes happening in the world around him.\nI learned of Ishi from Alfred Kroeber's wife and fellow anthropologist Theodora Kracaw Kroeber, who, in 1961, wrote \"Ishi in Two Worlds,\" now considered a classic of modern anthropology. I first read the book 40 years ago, and rereading it recently, I found myself placing Theodora Kroeber in the same league as Claude Lévi-Strauss. Without ever leaving any of her anthropological principles behind, she consistently writes clear, compelling prose.\nIt isn't easy reading the first part of Kroeber's book, watching as Ishi and the remaining members of his band are forced to withdraw further and further from the whites encroaching upon their world; until, finally, they retreat into that world's last untouched cañon, and, ultimately, its last bushy slopes.\nBut Kroeber's description of the way Ishi handles the world he is then brought into, the way he maintains his Yahi dignity in the face of that world's awesome power (while never losing his ability to see through its sometimes absurd idiosyncrasies) is somehow reassuring. It gave me hope for humanity at large.\nI reread \"Ishi in Two Worlds\" thanks to an Inter-Library Loan, but a copy of the book has now been placed in our collection at the Talbot County Free Library. You'll find it in the Easton library on the Biography shelves under the call letters ISHI. If you're in St. Michaels, you can place a reserve on the book and it will be sent down there for you. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Thoughts on smart phone restrictions in schools\n\n October 19, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 981\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n A recent Pew Research Center survey reports that 95% of teenagers in America have a smart phone or have access to one. It also reports that 45% of teenagers say they are online nearly all the time.Many have suggested this has resulted in a measurable and serious negative impact on the learning environment in middle and high school classrooms. Others have suggested this has resulted in a serious negative impact on standardized student achievement test scores.\nAs a result, countless school districts in America have put or will be putting new or more restrictions on student smart phones during the school day. Two-thirds of schools in Maryland have already. Talbot County is joining them. Beginning Dec. 2, Easton Middle School will will require students to lock their phones in secure pouches during the school day.\nThese restrictions have significant public support. Surveys conducted by the Talbot County school district reported 94% of parents/guardians and 96% of staff said there should be restrictions on cell phone use during the school day. 90% of parents/guardians and 95% of staff said students should not be allowed to have their phones \"visible and usable\" during class instruction.\nWhile I understand and respect these opinions, I suggest restrictions in schools are not addressing more deeply seated roots of the problem.\nIn his most recent book, \"The Anxious Generation How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness\" social psychologist Jonathan Stephen Haidt does a deep dive on a measurable surge in anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts among American youth.\nI understand and respect these decisions. At the same time, I suggest they are not addressing more deeply seated roots of the problem.\nIn his most recent book, \"The Anxious Generation How the Great Rewiring of Childhood is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness\" social psychologist Jonathan Stephen Haidt does a deep dive on a measurable surge in anxiety, depression, and suicidality among American youth.\nIn his book Haidt references research showing a measure of anxiety for individuals between ages of 8 to 25 has increased 139% between 2010 and 2020.The measure for depression during the same period, often the result of an inability to resolve interpersonal conflicts or relationship difficulties, has increased 106%.\nHaidt suggests three reasons why.\nThe first is the decline of the what Haidt calls play-based childhood. He maintains children need lots of free play time to prepare them for success as an adult. Out of fears for their safety, many American parents and guardians have reduced children's access to unsupervised free play. The loss of free play and the rise of continual (some may say \"smothering\") adult supervision has deprived children of what they needed most to overcome the normal fears and anxieties of childhood: the chance to explore, test and expand their limits, build close friendships through shared adventure and learn how to judge risks for themselves.\nThe second is what Haidt calls rise of the phone-based childhood, which began in the late 2000s and accelerated in the early 2010s. Haidt notes this was precisely the period during which adolescents traded in their flip phones for smartphones. These smartphones were loaded with social media platforms supported by the new high-speed internet and unlimited data plans that has drastically reshaped the social media landscape for adolescents.\nThe third is what Heidt calls an over reliance on technology that has all but eliminated unstructured face to face interactions from the lives of children and adolescents.\nHeidt concludes the negative impact of all three reasons was made worse by many well-intentioned parents, including himself. He writes: \"We did not fully understand what was happening in children's virtual worlds and did not grasp that tech companies had designed their online products to be addictive.\"\nAs a result, Haidt asserts that all these trends combined, have robbed entire generations of opportunities to develop the resilience, coping skills and independence needed to navigate everyday stressors, and in turn, created unprecedented levels of anxiety at a societal level.\nHe says these generations have not learned from valuable opportunities to engage in and learn from manageable risks, typical setbacks, failures and healthy social challenges.\nWhat can be done going forward?\nHaidt offers the following proactive suggestions for parents and guardians of children in elementary, middle and high schools.\nInstead of a giving younger students a smartphone as their first phone, give them a basic phone.\nDo not give them a smartphone until high school. Delay the opening of accounts on nearly all social media platforms until the beginning of high school, at least.\nWill his suggestions be popular with students? Not likely, especially given the immense power of peer pressure that characterizes life for students in schools at all levels.\nOne school in Maryland recently surveyed seniors on a new more restrictive smart phone policy to limit the overuse of smart phones during the school day. The questions and answers were: \"Do you know overuse of cell phones is harmful? Yes. Do you want to give it up? No.\"\nAre Haidt's suggestions still necessary since efforts are underway when an increasing number of schools are adopting on new or more restrictive rules on smart phone access? Yes.\nDespite best intentions and best efforts, schools alone cannot address this problem. One Maryland school district superintendent has observed with thinly disguised frustration — \"Students are in school for just 20% of their week. We can't control the other 80% of the time that we don't have them.\"\nThose with some control over most of the other 80% of student's time outside of school are parents and guardians.\nGoing forward, parents and guardians need to fully embrace two concepts. Success for them is not based on winning a popularity contest with those whom they are entrusted with their care and upbringing. Success for them is measured in part by a willingness to make sometimes unpopular, but necessary decisions on reasonable limits for a young person's own good.\nIn preparing all our young people for success, they, and our society deserve nothing less. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

This event not only contributes to the care of students of all ages, but it creates community for residents throughout Easton.\nBeth Anne Dorman, president and chief executive officer at For All Seasons, said the resource fair has become one of the largest community events in Easton, bringing together over 25 different organizations and over 1,700 people.\n\"We are really taking care of all of the kids in the ways that set them up for success,\" Dorman said. \"For school, mental health isn't just about our mental health and talk therapy, but it's also about making sure that children have what they need to be able to show up at the school year authentically and with some safety.\"\nIn addition to the school supplies provided by For All Seasons, dozens of organizations set up tables and provided rulers, pens, dental care kits, notebooks and over a hundred children's books.\nMarilou Russ, assistant director for Appleseed Books, said the organization provides free children's books to families across the Eastern Shore by collecting donated books.\n\"We come to programs and events throughout the counties on the mid shore, which would include Caroline, Talbot and now even Dorchester County, and then we give the children out the free books so that they have books,\" Russ said. \"Our belief is that they have their own collection of books that they can call their own.\"\nIncluded in the event, families had the opportunity to enjoy games, free Rita's Italian Ice, and arts and craft activities.\nMayra Casillas, an event attendee, said she just moved to the area and learned of the fair on Facebook. For Casillas, it seemed a great opportunity to engage with her new community and for her children to have fun.\n\"It's also great to have backpacks and a bunch of other school supplies,\" Casillas said. \"It helps families that don't have the income to buy for their kids.\"\nDorman said the event has grown significantly since its origin six years ago. It has reached the point where For All Seasons will be expanding the venue for next year since it has become too crowded for Idlewild Park. Dorman said she is proud of this event and the amount of people it assists.\n\"There are times where we have an opportunity to dig in a little bit deeper as a community,\" Dorman said. \"This is an example of when we think outside of the box, and we really think about the whole person when we're thinking about mental health. It gives us an opportunity to make a difference in a way that maybe is not going to happen in the four walls of an office, but this is real community outreach and community connection and partnership.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum celebrates 60 years\n\n April 18, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: AHMAD GARNETT agarnett@chespub.com | Section: News \n \n 737\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n ST.MICHAELS — A staple of St. Michaels, the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum is celebrating 60 years.Volunteers spearheaded the creation of the museum, which opened in 1965 at Navy Point and was accredited in 1978.\n\"The museum really started out by a community effort,\" said Pete Lesher, chief historian and ambassador at large at the museum. \"The collections were built with an outpouring from the community over the idea that the place is changing and we need to establish a museum to remember the way it was.\"\nLesher, came to the museum in 1991 as a curator. He said the museum was created in a \"series of themes\" to represent the Bay and people around the it.\nMUSEUM HISTORY\nThe museum started in May 1965 with two buildings that had been on the grounds since 1850 the Higgins house and the Dodson house. The eagle house building arrived in 1870. The three buildings now serve as administrative buildings after serving as exhibit buildings for nine years in the early days.\nAccording to Lesher, the land where the museum's lighthouse and other exhibits now sit was reclaimed from the Bay.\n\"This was just a shallow part of the park,\" Lesher said. \"You would have been standing probably knee deep sinking into mud about 150 years ago.\n\"This area started with actually a sawmill and grist mill but moved beyond that to seafood packing houses, and by the height here in the 1930s and 1940s, there were four different seafood packing houses out on this point. Every time they wanted to expand, they simply discarded more oyster shells, which they end up on themselves, pushing them into the harbor and built more land.\"\nWilliam Coulbourne and Frederick Jewett were two African American business owners who owned one of the four businesses on the land.\n\"They were early 20th century Black entrepreneurs from Crisfield, Maryland, who moved up here,\" Lesher said. \"They learned the business and managed to get somebody to sell them land and managed to get somebody to give them a bank loan — a remarkable success story.\"\nThe museum plans to honor Coulbourne and Jewitt by renaming its education building after the two entrepreneurs.\nThe lighthouse, which is featured in the museum's logo, is the first historical structure the museum collected. It was acquired in 1966 when the Coast Guard was demolishing lighthouses \"left and right\" because of vandalism, according to Lesher.\nThe museum bought the lighthouse from the demolition company and moved it 50 miles north to the museum site.\n\"It was so early in our history, it became our logo,\" Lesher said. \"The lighthouse is sort of what identifies the museum.\"\nOne of the new changing exhibits at the museum is the Sailing to Freedom exhibit, which highlights the Underground Railroad on the water.\n\"So we think of the Underground Railroad like the Harriet Tubman story of running up the Delmarva Peninsula to get to Philadelphia and freedom,\" Lesher said.\n\"Well, a lot of people made it by boat, whether they got a ticket on a steamboat, got away that way or stowed away on a coast-wise schooner, so many of them on the Chesapeake Bay, while the Chesapeake Bay forms a natural watery highway to the north. This was a route to freedom for many of those freedom seekers,\" he said. \"That's what we try to show with this exhibit.\"\nHELPING THE COMMUNITY\nIn addition to exhibits for museum-goers, the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum uses some exhibits to help with the curriculum in Talbot County schools.\nAn exhibit displaying the Maryland Crab Meat Company sits where the museum holds the Chesapeake's Best Crab Cakes program, in which third and fifth graders receive math, reading and social studies credits in the curriculum.\n\"The Chesapeake's Best Crab Cakes program meets learning goals for for math, for reading and for social studies in the Maryland curriculum,\" Lesher said. \"Every Talbot County third grader and fifth grader has an experience tied to their curriculum, tied to their learning goals right here in the museum.\"\nThe museum also conducts an apprenticeship program where museum staff work with an apprentice for two years, ultimately leading to a state credential.\nAccording to Lesher, the museum has hired some of these apprentices as permanent shipyard crew.\nThe museum has partnered with the St. Michaels Community Center on multiple occasions.\n\"We're working to do more community collaborations with them because both our missions align, and we want to enrich the lives of people who live in St. Michaels,\" said Amy Horne, executive director of the community center. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

I hope the following encouraging tips from your fellow readers on how to be a frugal rockstar will inspire all of us to pay attention and embrace ways we can immediately begin to see more money left in our wallets.Over the past six months, I've been on a tear to declutter and get organized. It has made a huge impact on my spending.Basically, I've stopped spending money on stuff I have already but just didn't know where to find it. The key is knowing what you have and finding it when needed. If you can't find your stuff easily, you might buy something you already have or, even worse, believe you got rid of it, buy a replacement, and then find the original shortly after. - Millie, New Jersey We have a new weekly menu item at our house - Everything But the Kitchen Sink Soup. Basically, this is just throwing a bunch of whateveris-in-the-fridge to make a soup in order to get rid of stuff that's about to go bad or otherwise needs to be used up. You can put so much stuff into soups, and you can freeze leftover soup, too. Really helps to prevent food waste. If you need instructions on how to do this, look up Cotter-Crunch.com. When you get there, use the search function to find that \"recipe.\" - Erica, California I started using grocery delivery during the pandemic. Even taking into consideration the monthly/annual delivery fee, I've stuck with it because it significantly reduces my impulse buys, which continues to save us money. And we have all but eliminated spending on junk food. - Molly, Pennsylvania \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

MICHAELS — During the St. Michaels Commissioners meeting on Wednesday, St. Michaels Police Chief Jeffrey Oswald said the police department will lose an 18-year veteran officer to another municipality. The officer, he said, is leaving for better pay.\"I'm coming up on my 24th year here, three as chief, and during this time, I've seen 43 officers come and go in our agency,\" Oswald said. \"Obviously, there are several factors that contribute to some of the turnover, but the prominent and consistent driver from the exit interviews has been paying upward mobility.\"\nStarting on Thursday, the St. Michaels Police Department will be operating with only four officers, excluding Oswald.\nOswald mentioned one of the reasons that officers leave besides salary is opportunities larger departments can provide.\n\"They have criminal investigation divisions, they have training divisions dedicated solely to ensure officers meet certifications, qualifications and criminal updates… and remember, each of these on their own is a full-time specially trained position,\" Oswald said. \"... Every St. Michaels Police Department (officer) must be able to perform every one of these rules at any given time, and therefore, after a few years, an officer builds a strong resume and they take it to another agency who's more than happy to pay them some extra money.\"\nOswald suggested potentially hiring a police recruiting firm and raising wages commensurate to officers' total years of service.\n\"We're a good place to have an opportunity to do a reset because there's only four of us remaining,\" Oswald said.\nAccording to Town Manager Don Richardson, the police department has four openings with two each at the corporal and sergeant level.\nWith potential salary raises, the cost would be north of $200,000 for the town to properly recruit and retain officers, Richardson said.\nCommissioner Alexis Roiter mentioned accommodation taxes, which are paid by tourists who stay at hotels or rental properties, as a potential revenue source for police department needs. Commissioner David Wojciechowski mentioned allocating funds from town events.\nThe commissioners agreed to draft legislation allowing for salary amendments so the St. Michaels Police Department can become competitive in hiring and retention. The measure would have to go through the town's typical legislative process, which would include public hearings, before it can be adopted.\n\"Thank you for supporting this important need for the town of St. Michaels and our community,\" Richardson said. \"It will ultimately require some level of budgeting amendment that will absolutely go through a public comment period and a legislative ordinance.\"\nThe town encourages anyone interested in joining the St. Michaels Police Department to contact the town for further instruction. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Talbot Family Network, the board responsible for the county's youth and family services, will serve as the commission.\nAfter the public hearing yielded no comments, the council moved the bill to third reading and approved it 4-0. Council member Lynn Mielke abstained.\nThe county must use the money for community-based initiatives, as defined by state law, such as after-school, behavioral health, housing or homeless prevention programs. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "'Proven leader': Easton will soon welcome Kitzrow as new town manager\n\n June 21, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 740\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — After nearly a year without a permanent town manager, Easton will welcome Andy Kitzrow next month.Kitzrow, the current Salisbury city administrator, was tapped by Mayor Megan Cook to assume the post from Police Chief Alan Lowrey, the interim town manager since August. Kitzrow begins July 7.\nDuring an interview in Salisbury last week, Kitzrow said he instantly noticed opportunity in Easton.\n\"The more I looked at Easton, the more I started to fall in love with where they're going,\" Kitzrow said.\nThe new town manager is Cook's most major appointment in her two years as mayor. Kitzrow will oversee town operations, lead department heads and town staff, and be a point of contact with the mayor and Town Council members.\nAfter whittling down a list of around 12 semifinalists, the town conducted full-day interviews with four finalists. It was an intensive but worthwhile process, Cook said.\nShe felt Kitzrow rose above the others, as he was up to speed on what's happening in Easton and meshed well with her and with town employees.\n\"(Staff) really thought of the candidates, he could get up and running the fastest because he had the background of Maryland politics,\" Cook said.\nKitzrow, 42, served as Wicomico County recreation superintendent before becoming Salisbury's deputy city administrator in 2017 and city administrator in 2023.\nIn Salisbury, Kitzrow worked under three different mayors, including Jake Day, now the Department of Housing and Community Development secretary. Day noted Kitzrow's oversight of city permit and procurement operations as especially impactful.\n\"It's not easy work, but he's a proven leader,\" Day said of Kitzrow. \"Somebody who can do it.\"\nCook says while the Day connection didn't factor into her decision, it will benefit Easton as the town tackles its own housing challenges and initiatives.\n\"Having that relationship, I think, is great. It's key,\" Kitzrow said. \"A lot of this is about relationships, whether they are elected officials or state officials.\"\nA BETTER FIT\nWorking under three different mayors, Kitzrow says he's experienced three very different visions.\nIn early 2023, Day left Salisbury with then-city administrator Julia Glanz to head up the state's housing and community development efforts. Jack Heath served as mayor until current Mayor Randy Taylor won an election later that year.\nDuring Day's tenure, Salisbury undertook a number of efforts to redevelop its downtown through programs providing tax incentives to developers, such as \"Here is Home\" and HORIZON — the latter aimed at bringing multifamily residential and hotel units, an initiative which Kitzrow championed.\n\"(He was) the mastermind behind the HORIZON legislation that we passed locally,\" Glanz said.\nTaylor and developers have clashed in recent months over the stalling of downtown projects, some of which were approved by former mayors and councils. In April, DelmarvaNow.com reported that developers of a downtown project filed a $40 million lawsuit against Salisbury and Taylor.\nWhile Kitzrow believes the change in vision is OK and can be solved through compromise, he acknowledges it factored into his choice to accept the Easton post. Neither Taylor nor Heath could be reached for an interview.\n\"Professionally and personally, the town that Megan wants to run and her goals align more with what I value and what I want to be part of,\" Kitzrow said.\nGOALS IN EASTON\nSalisbury's population is nearly double Easton's, but Kitzrow sees similar challenges and opportunities in the two areas.\nHe said he wants to \"move projects forward in a smart way.\" In Salisbury, he's dealt with a housing pipeline of around 5,000 units and led a focus on building \"from the inside out.\" Easton's pipeline has recently hovered around 1,000 units.\nKitzrow is hoping to bring a focus to Easton's Rails to Trails network, given his parks and recreation background, as well as get \"under the hood\" in the human resources department.\nCook said she's excited to bring on a consistent leader during what she says has been a year full of change in town. \"I'm looking forward to a steady ship ... and some calm seas ahead,\" Cook said.\nWorking for the mayor, Kitzrow emphasized that strong relationships with the Town Council will be crucial in completing the work that will make Easton a better place.\n\"We are working together, not against each other, and I think that's important,\" Kitzrow said.\nKitzrow will remain living in Salisbury with his wife and kids. He owns Escape Salisbury, a downtown escape room business.\nBut he's looking to learn as much about Easton as possible. He said he's especially excited to meet business owners, nonprofit leaders and community members in his first 60 days on the job. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

It would be helpful for the Star to provide bylines for OpEds with political themes. In this case, it would show that David Reel is the former chairman of the Talbot County Republican Central Committee.This OpEd is characteristic of what I call the post 2016 American Enterprise sandwich. The American Enterprise Institute is the longtime conservative redoubt that has employed the likes of Newt Gingrich and Dinesh D'Souza.In off-year elections, the party not in the White House characteristically does very, very well. In 2016, the Republican Party let their extreme Donald Trump flag fly with disappointing results including the continuing speaker of the House fiasco and legislative stalemate because of the Republican Party's slimmest of majorities.The American Enterprise sandwich is a way for the conservative fringe to further itself with the veneer of non-combative moderation. The sandwich opens with a seemingly nonpartisan theme, in this case challenges and opportunities for Democrats and Republicans in addressing the African American electorate.The meat follows with opinion and statistics which are negative for the Democratic Party. The final section contains platitudes about listening to the electorate.Any piece dealing with how the Republican Party relates to the African American electorate that does not include the nationwide voter suppression efforts targeting that community cannot be taken seriously.In the case of David Reel's OpEd, it is not only in the style of the American Enterprise sandwich, but all the opinion is from American Enterprise staff and all the data is from American Enterprise surveys.Be on the look out for this type of opinion piece and remember that Donald Trump is overwhelmingly favored to be the presidential candidate for the Republican Party in 2024. Donald Trump is an existential threat to our democracy, and any attempts to distract from that reality should be ignored.HOLLY WRIGHTEastonDo more, with moreQuality education is the foundation of any flourishing society. As diversity, equity and inclusion get forced into everyday life by small groups around America, what happened to education?Groups are trying to measure equity and inclusion but seem to be totally ignoring the measurement of our schools and student performance.One recent report cited 13 public schools in Baltimore with less than 5% of students passing math and reading at grade level. How are voters not horrified and ashamed?Our governor is at public events for the arts and everything else under the sun but what has been offered to measure concrete improvements to our school, teacher and student performance? Has anyone in government or the Department of Education set a performance milestone to address this total failure. How can anyone so blatantly ignore these failing grades.There are the parades and protests supporting just about any cause or whim but not for education.Just a thought: How about our governor and the Board of Education and teachers union commit that 50% of Baltimore students will pass reading and math at grade level before the next election in 2026. 50% is still embarrassingly poor but it would be a start. (70% in the other state school districts.)Do any tax paying or voting citizens think 50% is too big of a job for our leaders? Would our teachers themselves accept a failure rate of 50%? Apparently so and for years. These results were here before COVID-19, and the money has been available for many years. Look at how much has been spent per student in our Baltimore public schools compared to the much more successful schools around the country.Clearly, money in Maryland is not the problem. Do more, with more. Accountability.We need measurable commitments from Gov. Moore and the dducation department followed by results before the next election cycle. We need to stop hiding from this clear failure of our youth and present the voting public with a plan to enforce measurement results.We are anxiously waiting.RICH ADRIANEaston \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Ross scheduled a plea hearing for Aug. 19, the first day of when Rider's trial was supposed to begin, and a sentencing hearing for October.\nRider is accused of setting his house on fire in November 2022.\nThrough investigation, officials identified the fire as an act of human intervention with an open flame, classifying the cause of fire as incendiary. According to court documents, Rider's reckless conduct in igniting the house on fire \"clearly\" put more than 45 firefighters who responded in danger as they suppressed the fire.\nAt the status hearing Tuesday, Talbot County Assistant State's Attorney Jennifer Wilson said Rider plans to plead guilty to first-degree arson and five counts of reckless endangerment. She said the state plans to enter nolle prosequi for Rider's remaining nine charges, meaning the state will not prosecute for those charges.\nRider's attorney Christine DuFour, who took over from attorney Stephanie Shipley in April, said Rider's divorce proceedings with Kari Rider are happening parallel to this case. She said it would be helpful to know the outcome of the divorce before Rider is handed a sentence because the divorce will have an affect on the sentencing.\nThe sentencing was scheduled for Oct. 4, a little over a week after the final hearing in Rider's divorce process.\nWilson said the state is not opposed to Rider being handed suspended consecutive sentences for the reckless endangerment counts. DuFour said the state could seek restitution in the plea agreement, but that has not been determined.\nRider was supposed to stand trial March 4, but at a status hearing that morning, Ross said Rider had been voluntarily admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital and issued a bench warrant for Rider's failure to appear in court that morning. After getting discharged, Rider was granted a request to be transferred to an alcohol and drug rehab facility for 60 days, with the condition that he return to the Talbot County Detention Center upon completing the program.\nOn May 14, the detention center was ordered to release Rider on a previously posted $20,000 unsecured bond. Rider was released on conditions including that he surrender his passport, he reside in a sober living home in Pasadena, he attend Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous meetings and he enroll in mental health services.\nThis report has been updated from an earlier version to clarify the state's opinion on Rider potentially receiving suspended consecutive sentences. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Easton planners: amid affordable housing shortage, inclusionary zoning may be useful\n\n January 23, 2025 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Konner Metz | Section: Local News \n \n 1134\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — Through her work at the Chesapeake Multicultural Resource Center, Daisy Aguilar interacts with many prospective first-time homebuyers. Of the many challenges they face, housing prices in Easton and Talbot County are at the top of the list.\"The houses, they're not affordable right now,\" Aguilar, the center's housing coordinator, said. \"And most people that are buying, they're buying in Dorchester County because it's more affordable than it is in Talbot County.\"\nAn inclusionary zoning ordinance in the works could pave the way for more affordable homeownership and rental opportunities in Easton. It would require residential developers to allocate 15% of their units as affordable, defined separately for ownership and rental.\nInclusionary units in ownership developments would need to meet an affordable price for households making up to 100% of area median income, while rental developments would need to meet prices affordable for households making up to 60% of area median income.\nAccording to Jim Bent, chair of the Affordable Housing Board, Easton's area median income was around $98,000 last year.\nWhile similar legislation has faced hurdles in the past, town leaders and affordable housing proponents are hopeful the time is now for inclusionary zoning to be implemented.\nEASTON'S WORKFORCEEaston Mayor Megan Cook is well aware of the fact many can't afford to live in town, including essential workers, town employees and police officers.\n\"When you're sworn to protect and serve a community, yet you can't even live in the community that you're dedicating your life to, that says something,\" Cook said. \"That's not quite the message we should be sending people.\"\nAccording to the draft ordinance, Census data shows that 42% of around 17,000 Talbot County workers commute into the county. Cook and others are hoping the ordinance can lower that percentage.\n\"A lot of the people who work in those fields earn wages where they have been priced out of the Easton market, and so their only option is to find housing in adjacent counties,\" said Miguel Salinas, Easton's director of planning and zoning.\nFor homebuyers, the local market is a significant challenge. According to the Mid-Shore Board of Realtors, the average home price in Talbot County in 2024 was $856,000.\nTown staff's calculation of the maximum affordable home price for a family of four making the area median income is $292,000.\n\"There was a time, a couple years, not too long ago, that houses were affordable,\" Aguilar said. \"I mean, they were selling fast, but they were affordable. And at least you had the possibility of actually getting a house.\"\nTHE ORDINANCESalinas, who has led the town's efforts to create the ordinance, recognizes it is just one piece of the puzzle. But it's a critical step, he said.\n\"This is one tool in the toolbox. And it's been discussed for 20-plus years,\" Salinas said.\nSince it was initially presented in February 2023, Salinas said the ordinance has endured many revisions, along with being viewed by the town's Affordable Housing Board, Attainable Housing Task Force and an outside contractor.\nTown planners looked at similar provisions in jurisdictions such as Queen Anne's County, Annapolis and Frederick when drafting the ordinance.\nA draft version of the inclusionary housing ordinance was passed 4-1 by the town's Planning Commission last November.\nPlanning Commission member Michael Ports, speaking for himself and not the commission, said the inclusionary zoning ordinance would do two things particularly well. It would push the \"cost burden predominantly away from existing residents\" and incentivize developers to build inclusionary units.\nIn addition to the requirement that 15% of units fit the inclusionary definitions, the ordinance would grant developers that provide inclusionary units on the same site as market-rate units with a 20% density bonus.\nSuch aspects of the ordinance encourage mixed-income projects, which town leaders believe can help to reduce housing inequities.\n\"Housing segregation opens the door to other types of segregation, and you can certainly see that in many, many communities,\" Salinas said. \"But not just racial and ethnic, but also age.\"\nTom Klein, the Planning Commission's sole vote against the ordinance, says he is a proponent of more affordable and workforce housing. He believes inclusionary zoning is not \"necessary nor a cost-effective way\" to achieve that goal.\n\"For the past two years that I have been on the Planning Commission, just about every new development proposal has come with a component of affordable/workforce housing,\" Klein wrote in an email.\nRecent developments that provide the town with affordable housing include projects from The Arc Central Chesapeake Region, such as Port Street Commons, a multi-use property with nine affordable apartment units that opened in December, and Silo Square, a mixed-income housing project greenlit in October.\nRevitalization of the Doverbrook Apartments complex in Easton is underway and will feature an additional 14 affordable units on top of 50 existing ones. On Elliott Road, more than 100 apartments are under construction, a portion of those affordable.\nLast July, the town approved the annexation of 17 acres of land for a housing project on the east side of Route 50. In the annexation agreement, developers agreed at least 50% of the project's apartment units will be affordable.\nGiven the number of ongoing projects, Klein says he feels inclusionary zoning would not \"provide a significant number\" of additional affordable units.\nBut Ports believes the ordinance will ensure that the limited supply of undeveloped land in the town is being used properly.\n\"It's really the biggest asset any community has,\" Ports said. \"If we want to allow someone to potentially change it forever, we need to make sure that they're investing in the community in some way.\"\nREGULATIONAt the November Planning Commission meeting, Klein and other commission members expressed concerns of overregulation prior to voting on the ordinance.\n\"I think that the market's taking care of it,\" Klein said. \"I think that we're putting a lot of regulation here. Like I said, I think there could be a lot of unintended consequences that come out of that and a lot of cost for what we get out of it.\"\nSalinas and Bent both said the market hasn't been able to address ballooning home and rental costs in recent years.\nBent said he's heard from planning commissioners in the past that a \"tool\" is needed to point developers toward what the town wants in terms of affordability.\nWhile proponents of inclusionary zoning are confident it can be this tool, they recognize the housing problem in Easton is complex.\n\"If we got into this hole of housing deficiency over the course of decades, it's impossible to fix that in one year, let alone even 10 years,\" Ports said. \"It will be a game of playing catch-up.\"\nCook hopes Easton residents, along with the Town Council, see affordable housing as a top challenge to tackle.\n\"I do hope that they see the importance of this issue, and I also hope that the community itself sees the importance of the issue,\" Cook said. \"For the longevity and the vibrancy of the Town of Easton, it's an important issue.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Bodman, who is charged with manslaughter, distribution and possession with the intent to distribute narcotics, distribution and possession with intent to distribute fentanyl or heroin, possession of a controlled dangerous substance, reckless endangerment and conspiracy.Police also announced that Elina Lazarieva, 23, of Easton was arrested in Baltimore on Aug. 2 on similar charges.The charges stem from the duo's alleged involvement in an overdose death in Easton.Easton officers were dispatched to the 100 block of Prospect Avenue on Sept. 5, 2022, for an unresponsive man.Talbot County paramedics also responded and pronounced the man, identified as 28-year-old Cristian Gonzales, dead.Easton police's criminal investigation division initiated an investigation, learning that Lazarieva had met with Bodman for the purpose of obtaining controlled dangerous substances.Police said Lazarieva contacted Bodman and the two traveled to Delaware to obtain heroin.After obtaining the heroin, the two traveled back to Easton and delivered the drug to Gonzales, who later overdosed, police said.Both Bodman and Lazarieva were turned over to the Talbot County Detention Center following their arrests.Lazarieva was released on bond Sept. 12, according to online court records. Her case is scheduled for a jury trial in Talbot County Circuit Court in early January. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

So if you wanted to go to a family-friendly happy, fun celebration out in your community, that's what this is.\" This year, even the buttons for participants are free. Kilmon said that while the collectable buttons have been something for purchase in the past, they are free of charge this year.\n\"A lot of people collect them, and this is the 30th-year button,\" Kilmon said.\nThe buttons are available at the Easton Visitor Center on Harrison Street. They can be picked up the day of the event or anytime before that.

The ancillary building is under renovation, and the wooden device was put in before locks were installed on the new door.She posted a picture on social media on Wednesday seeking information on the bifurcated conundrum of source of donation and original use.Unravelling riddles is not the only mission underway at RLM - the building the device was deposited in is in the final stages of renovation.Ferguson said the building has had many purposes over the years, but probably not for the storage of a carriage. The building, damaged in a 2020 storm, saw the renovation begin in 2021.The building was a notion shop at one point, and it was moved to its current location on Backtown Road from Trappe's Main Street around 1900.It also served as housing for migrant workers, who slept in the loft, and was also used as an office and possibly a garage for the canning facility previously located on what is now the museum grounds.Anyone with information on what the device is or where it came from is asked to email rurallifemuseum@gmail.com or call 410-476-4857.More information about the Rural Life Museum is available online at trapperurallifemuseum.org. \n \n Caption: MIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nRenovation on the Rural Life Museum's Carriage House is nearing completion.\n \nMIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nRural Life Museum Board of Directors President Elizabeth Ferguson dusts off the lastest donation to the organization's collection\n \nMIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nThe source and original use for this wooden implement remains unknown.\n \nMIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nThe mystery device's arm raises and lowers to drop a wooden peg into a metal reinforced hole.\n \nMIKE DETMER/STAR DEMOCRAT\n \nThe Rural Life Museum is located at 29241 Backtown Road in Trappe. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

She brings them back to life,\" Lewis said. \"They start singing, they start dancing, they remember all the words to each one of the songs. It's wonderful to see how she can interact. It's almost like a different way of communicating.\"\nAccording to Northwestern University, musical intervention has therapeutic benefits for people with dementia or Alzheimer's disease and has been proven to decrease a patient's agitation and improve communication.\nMegan Pinder, director of sales and marketing for HeartFields Assisting Living, said HeartFields had begun partnering with the Chesapeake Center about two years ago. The volunteer-led programs began with a bird club where volunteers come to the Heartfields and fill up the 41 bird feeders every week for the residents to enjoy.\nThen TiShawna, an active volunteer at the Chesapeake Center, began to come and play music for residents at HeartFields.\nAccording to Pinder, the first holiday concert was a resounding success, and TiShawna Jordan was presented with roses by the HeartFields Resident Ambassador because her playing had moved many attendees to tears.\nElsie Jordan, mother of TiShawna Jordan, said her daughter was always musically inclined. As a child she would play the keyboard, and Elsie Jordan said she would help her daughter learn new music through humming songs.\nDuring the concert, Elsie Jordan sat next to her daughter humming and singing along to classic Christmas songs such as \"White Christmas\" and \"Jingle Bell Rock.\" At some points they would both sing, encouraging the crowd of attendees to raise their voices and fully enjoy the memory of the holidays.\n\"God gave her that gift, and I want her to share her gift with other people,\" Elsie Jordan said. \"Because if it wasn't for God, she wouldn't have the gift she has. I feel like it's a gift and you shouldn't have to be paid for something you love doing. And she loves playing.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Beyond Oktoberfest and Halloween, many cities offer harvest festivals as local crops come into season. Others organize arts and crafts shows or music festivals, while local wineries debut their latest releases.The allure of fall foliage may put cars on the road, but the states on LawnStarter's shortlist have found creative ways to reward visitors for their interest.TOP FIVE STATES FOR VIEWING FALL FOLIAGECaliforniaCalifornia ranks at or near the top in virtually every metric used in the LawnStarter study. It has the most national parks, the most scenic drives, and the most Fall-related attractions. Outside of Sacramento, Apple Hill features over 50 local farms and a fall festival with apple cider donuts and u-pick pumpkin and apple venues. The Napa Valley is famous for its fall foliage, along with wine tastings and grape stomping adventures.New YorkOne measurement used in the LawnStarter study was the number of peak days for the leaf-watching season. New York ranked highest, with a total of 31 days of ideal leaf peeping available. New York is also home to the Finger Lakes, renowned for their cideries. Other points of interest include the Adirondacks and the Catskills for hiking and historical towns such as Sleepy Hollow for ghost chasing.WashingtonWashington State's mountainous and forested terrain offers adventurous foliage seekers over 12 weeks of peak viewing time. Besides a generous number of hiking trails and national parks, visitors to Washington State can also visit the alpinethemed village of Leavenworth for its Autumn Leaf Festival and enjoy adult beverages at local wineries.MichiganMichigan's extended foliage viewing season of 12 weeks makes it very appealing for Midwesterners who seek a more local destination than coastal states. Michigan also has a high number of cideries, ranking second overall in the Lawn-Starter study. A scenic drive north of Harbor Springs is known as the Tunnel of Trees and offers travelers breathtaking views of hardwood trees and their colorful leaves. The Pumpkin Train is another popular Fall-related attraction located in western Michigan.PennsylvaniaPennsylvania's abundance of undeveloped forests helps land it in the fifth position on the Lawn-Starter survey. The view of tree-covered hills and rolling pastures has enticed visitors for literally hundreds of years. The Pocono Mountains host the annual Jim Thorpe Fall Foliage Festival, a ghost tour, and a scenic train ride.THE BEST TIME TO GO LEAF PEEPINGWhile the first leaves may start to change as early as mid-September, the peak Fall foliage season doesn't generally arrive until the middle to late part of October, when air temperatures also begin to drop in many regions. The most colorful part of the transition is often over by Thanksgiving, as leaves fade to brown and trees become bare.Min Park, Ph.D., Academic Program Coordinator School of Sport, Recreation, and Tourism Management at George Mason University, says, \"In general, fall foliage peaks in most parts of the nation in mid-October through mid-November.Some mountains in the northwest are often at their most colorful in mid-September to early October.\"As I live in Virginia, Virginia's Shenandoah National Park is one of the best for fall colors. The best time to experience gorgeous fall colors in Shenandoah National Park is in October. Visitors can make the scenic cruise along the 105-mile-long Skyline Drive, which offers 70 overlooks where travelers can hop out of the car for a better view of foliage with red, yellow, and orange leaves.\".FALL FESTIVALS AND OTHER ATTRACTIONSEven if fall foliage is not at its peak or travel options are limited, there are still many Autumnal activities individuals and families can enjoy. In many areas of the country, the temperatures and climate are still favorable for camping, hiking, and attending outdoor festivals.Rosa Abreu, Assistant Professor, Hospitality Management, New York City College of Technology, offers her suggestions for a satisfying fall-related excursion. \"Stay in a place that has a fire pit and roast marshmallows. Have a few drinks by the fire. Go glamping. Pumpkin and apple picking is always fun.\" Other fall-related festivals and destinations you might want to check out include: Morton Pumpkin Festival, Morton, Illinois The village of Morton, Illinois, produces almost all of the canned pumpkin products in the international market. The village considers itself to be the pumpkin capital of the world and celebrates annually with the Morton Pumpkin Festival in September.Salem, Massachusetts, Haunted ToursThe small coastal city of Salem, Massachusetts, has become a popular fall destination because of its association with the Salem witch trials. The city hosts several festivals throughout the fall season and guided tours of local landmarks.Vermont's Sugarhouses and Maple SyrupThe state of Vermont supplies over half of the country's maple syrup, and the fall months are the best time to watch the process unfold. Numerous sugarhouses in Vermont provide guided tours of their facilities, and guests also enjoy a taste of small-town New England life.World's Largest Corn Maze, Spring Grove, Illinois Corn mazes, hayrides, and harvest festivals are always popular destinations for families, and Richardson Farm in Spring Grove, Illinois, offers over 9 miles of hayride trails and mazes on its 28-acre cornfield.This article was produced by Media Decision and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks. \n \n Caption: WIKIMEDIA COMMONS/FLEMMING CHRISTIANSEN\n \nThere are plenty of places locally, across Maryland as well as travel spots nationally to check out autumn leaves and fall events.\n \nWIKIMEDIA COMMONS/LIZ WEST\n \nNew England is a popular destination to enjoy the sights of fall and the changing of the leaves \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

MICHAELS — On Wednesday evening, Andrew David Thaler carried a large wooden device with yellow cords piled in its interior and a yellow and black top into the St. Michaels commissioners meeting.Thaler, a member of the St. Michaels Climate Change/Sea Level Rise Commission, smiled as he eagerly presented the \"smart buoy.\"\nWith the permission of the commissioners, the Climate Change/Sea Level Rise Commission will put the buoy in the harbor to monitor water levels and flooding.\n\"What this buoy will do is it measures sea state, so we get sea surface temperature, we get wave action on the surface,\" Thaler said. \"And then we'll also have a pressure gage at the bottom of the mooring, which we'll be able to use to assess tidal head. So that'll give us both the actual tidal cycle coming into the harbor, as well as any storm surges coming up from the bay.\"\nAccording to Thaler, one of the long-term goals of the commission is to look into the viability of having the town's own tide gage.\nThe reasoning behind this goal is to gather specific data of St. Michaels tide pH. Currently, the data gathered for nuisance flooding, tidal surges and storm surges come from three sites. The sites are gages from Cambridge, Annapolis and Clayburn. Which are too far from St. Michaels to accurately gather information for the town.\nThaler said last year the commission applied for an equipment grant from So Far Ocean, a company that makes smart buoys. The presented device will gather data in real time and is solar powered.\nThaler said the location of the smart buoy will not interfere with boat traffic and will be located in the lagoon between Honeymoon Bridge and Mill Street. It comes at no cost to the town.\nAfter the presentation, the St. Michaels commissioners thanked Thaler and the Climate Change/Sea Level Rise Commission for all their efforts. Commissioners will vote on the use of a smart buoy during a future meeting. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Despite any self-doubt, Payne said, those gathered in the theater that evening were there to celebrate their own accomplishments and honor their potential to initiate positive change.\nIn the crowd were some of more than 200 nominees for this year's Women to Watch magazine, an annual publication by APG Chesapeake recognizing the contributions of women to Mid-Shore workplaces and communities.\nThe women, who were nominated via an online portal by coworkers, friends, spouses and loved ones, represented a wide swath of Mid-Shore change-makers.\n\"It was a wonderful evening to celebrate the power, success and perseverance of women to watch in the Mid-Shore,\" said Orestes Baez, regional president of APG Chesapeake. \"Everyone had a great story to tell and a great energy to share. APG Chesapeake did a wonderful job putting all the pieces together. We are thankful for the opportunity to share it with the public.\"\nThe event marked the launch of the fifth Women to Watch magazine, a preliminary printed version of which was unveiled at the Avalon that evening. The magazine will be inserted into the Star Democrat and available online April 23.\nPayne, who works through her nonprofit The BE Academy to empower women entrepreneurs, is one of 14 women featured in this year's edition. She was the first of three speakers to offer advice to those gathered April 9.\nYixin Qiu, co-founder of Apollo's Dream Foundation and a technical project manager for Qlarant, shared how she has worked to generate positive change in the Eastern Shore community that welcomed her as an immigrant a decade ago. Qiu helped found a nonprofit aiding senior citizens with digital literacy.\nJackie Wilson, senior vice president at Burke and Herbert Bank, shared advice for women experiencing change or uncertainty in their careers. She encouraged women to embrace change and rely on their expertise and the expertise of their teams to navigate challenges.\n\"What an uplifting evening,\" said Betsy Griffin, APG Chesapeake general manager for sales and marketing. \"It was great to see Mid-Shore women connecting and networking with other leaders. We are honored to provide a refreshing evening celebrating these women who serve in the community and excel in their workplaces. The friends, husbands, business associates, sons and daughters also all came out to join in for these special moments.

    "content": "Tony Shalhoub returns as \"Monk\" in new Peacock movie\n\n December 7, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Jay Bobbin | Page: D12 | Section: News \n \n 502\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n With the way that popular series of the past have been recycled - even in the streaming era that has added so much content - the second coming of \"Monk\" may not be that huge a surprise.As it happens, streaming is the avenue by which Tony Shalhoub is reprising his multiple-Primetime Emmy-winning portrayal of obsessive-compulsive detective Adrian Monk. Peacock premieres \"Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie\" on Friday, Dec. 8, with the hugely phobic title character on a very personal mission to help his journalist step-daughter Molly (\"Home Economics\" alum Caitlin McGee) when tragedy strikes as her wedding nears. The film might claim that this is Monk's final investigation, but of course, a ratings triumph for the picture can change that notion easily. (Consider that there have been three movie sequels to another former USA Network series, \"Psych,\" and a fourth has been under discussion.) Also an executive producer of the new film, Shalhoub isn't the only \"Monk' veteran returning for it. Series creator Andy Breckman (\"The Good Cop\") wrote the script and returns as an executive producer as well (with \"Hit & Run's\" David Hobernan also reprising the latter job), and Randy Zisk (\"Midnight Caller\") - who directed many of the original show's episodes, including the finale - calls the shots again on the movie.Other familiar faces from the \"Monk\" cast also are back. Traylor Howard (\"Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place\") again plays Natalie Teeger, who was Monk's second assistant on the show; Ted Levine (\"The Silence of the Lambs,\" 1991) and Jason Gray-Stanford (\"A Beautiful Mind,\" 2001) return as the police-connected Leland Stottlemeyer and Randy Disher; Hector Elizondo (\"Last Man Standing\") resurfaces as psychiatrist Neven Bell; and Melora Hardin (\"The Office\") resurfaces as Monk's late wife Trudy.\"Monk\" premiered on USA Network in 2002 and enjoyed an eight-season run, with Shalhoub earning three Primetime Emmy Awards for it along the way. John Turturro (\"Barton Fink,\" 1991) and Stanley Tucci (\"Big Night,\" 1996) each picked up an Emmy for guest stints on the show, and Randy Newman (\"Toy Story,\" 1995) won two of the honors for his musical contributions to it. Shalhoub also won a Golden Globe and two Screen Actors Guild Awards for the program.The series brought stardom to Shalhoub after his tenure as a respected supporting actor on stage and screen. When \"Monk\" began, he was known to viewers largely as Antonio on the sitcom \"Wings,\" and he also had gained notice for roles in such movies as \"Big Night\" (1996, with the aforementioned Tucci) and \"The Siege\" (1998). He also had earned the first of what would be his four Tony Award nominations to date, for \"Conversations With My Father\" (1992); his others have been for \"Golden Boy\" (2013), \"Act One\" (2014) and \"The Band's Visit\" (2017), and he won the honor for the latter play.For now, though, it's back to \"Monk\" territory for Shalhoub's - and though \"Last\" is in the movie's name, don't necessarily bank on that being the fact. \n \n Caption: Tony Shalhoub in \"Mr. Monk's Last Case: A Monk Movie\" \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Where did she get her start?A: The British Columbia native started out studying dancing as her principal path in show business, but her main attention shifted to acting when she was accepted at Toronto's Randolph Academy. She began doing guest roles on such series as \"Murdoch Mysteries\" and \"Star Trek: Discovery,\" then continued with appearances on shows including \"When Calls the Heart\" and \"The Bold Type.\" Around the time of the later guest shots, Kohan also started getting prominent parts in cable movies on the order of \"The Black Widow Killer\" (2018) and \"Love on Harbor Island\" (2020). The fact that those have been repeated often didn't hurt her chances to land the lead in \"Sullivan's Crossing,\" Among other movies that have featured Kohan are \"A Romance Wedding\" (2021) and \"A Whirlwind Wedding\" (2021), and she also was seen on the shows \"Batwoman,\" \"Transplant\" and \"When Hope Calls.\" Inspired by novels by Robyn Carr, \"Sullivan's Crossing\" (which already has been renewed for a second season) originated on Canada's CTV network, and its inclusion of two veterans of The CW in its regular cast - Chad Michael Murray (\"One Tree Hill\") and Scott Patterson (\"Gilmore Girls\") - likely got the latter outlet interested in picking up the series for the American market, especially when production delays linked to the entertainment-industry strikes made finding product from other sources a necessity. \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One transferred to North Caroline. One is injured. Two decided not to come out. We lost some guys we were going to be counting on as part of our season, so we're filling in.\"\nOne of those filling in for Colonel, 120-pounder Elisee Pierre-Louis, won by injury default. Pierre-Louis was taking Otto Perez to the mat, when the Easton freshman injured his arm while trying to brace his fall. Perez was taken by ambulance to have the injury treated.\n\"That was a momentum punch in the gut for the guys,\" Easton head coach Jason Biringer said of losing Perez.\nEaston (0-3) had built an early 12-0 lead on Skye Matthews' forfeit win at 106, and Esteban Velasquez' 1:59 pinfall over Brody Omohundro at 113.\nThe injury default cut Easton's lead in half, but Colonel (2-2) won the next three matches. Jayquan Wilkins crafted a 17-2 technical fall over John Seymour at 126, pulling Colonel within 12-11. Zy Nichols (132) and Evan Alexander (138) each won by forfeit, pushing the Colonels' lead to 23-12.\nThe Warriors stopped that streak when Adonis Schmidt pinned Trynton Parks in 59 seconds of the 144-pound match, drawing the visitors within 23-18.\nBut Colonel Richardson won six of the final seven matches, scoring bonus points in five of the bouts.\nAnthony Alexander (150) started Colonel's roll, pinning Matthew Bravo just as the first-period buzzer sounded. Gary Koeneman (157) followed, working a 19-4 technical fall over Vlad Oslam. Colonel's Ethan Thomas then got turned to his back, yet rolled through on the way to a 2:47 pinfall over Darren Foxwell at 165, stretching the Colonel lead to 40-18.\n\"They wrestled amazing,\" Hall said of his team. \"We've been shocked by Ethan Thomas. He's a freshman, just started wrestling last year in a middle school club. He's wrestling up a weight class and has been huge.\n\"Other guys we expected to win, won,\" Hall continued. \"Other guys we're expecting to go out there and wrestle hard, are. It's been a good season so far.\"\nTony Melendez got Easton back in the win column with a 1:07 fall over freshman Brox Meissner at 175. But the Colonels closed the match, with Richard Taylor (190) pinning Wahaab Popal in 2:15, Wilson Clough (215) winning by forfeit, and Chatydrick Pickrom (285) pinning Matthew Brunner in 2:45.\nStill, Biringer was encouraged by what he saw.\n\"We are seeing some better habits,\" Biringer said. \"We're also seeing some self-destructive moves, where it's, 'Don't make up your own moves. Do the moves you're taught.' Usually when something bad was happening they were trying something that wasn't a fundamental move. So it's beginner's mistakes, but at the same time a lot more effort, and progress is being made.\"\nColonel's girls earned 39-22 victory in what was Easton's first girls dual meet. Each team won two of the four matches wrestled.\nColonel's Luna Infante-Reyes (115) pinned Leah Gonzalez-Reyes in 3:38, and Estelle Lima (190) earned a 7-0 decision over Khadija Popal.\nEaston's wins came from Shiza Gondal (135), who pinned Lizzy Hesson, and Thanh Mai Pham (140), who earned a 10-2 major decision over Aiyanna Groce. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

One weapon in this armoury of attack is the five card weak two-bid. It isn't my style, but it does have its moments, like in today's deal.North expected a six-card suit opposite.Against four hearts doubled, West led the diamond ace: five, three, four. He continued with three rounds of hearts to stop a diamond ruff in the dummy.To make the contract, South had to establish a spade for a diamond discard, and he had to find the club queen. He played a spade to dummy's king, cashed the ace and ruffed a spade in hand.Declarer judged that West had three diamond honours because East hadn't played a higher diamond at trick one. Along with the heart ace-king and spade queen, that made at least 17 points.Clearly East, not West, had the club queen. However, South had to be careful.He led the club seven to dummy's king. Next came the club jack. East didn't cover, so the jack won the trick. Now followed a spade ruff, the club ace, a club to dummy's 10 and the fifth spade for a diamond discard.Well played!If East had covered the club jack, declarer would have won with his ace and played the club nine to dummy's 10. Then, after a spade ruff, the carefully preserved club two would have been led to dummy's four to allow the discard on the spade 10.Finally, note that the opening lead of the heart eight will defeat the contract - but would anyone find that?©2023, UNITED FEATURE SYNDICATE DISTRIBUTED BY ANDREWS MCMEEL SYNDICATION FOR UFS \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

After the first and second were wanted by him, the latest forced him to change his perspective quickly upon joining his fourth NHL organization.\n\"I don't think there's any time for anybody to feel sorry about themselves,\" Dubois said on a video call with reporters Wednesday, one year short of the anniversary of signing his current contract. \"You learn in the hockey world teams will do what they think is better for their team, and there's no hard feelings. For me, I could take it multiple ways, but I'm choosing to take it as extra motivation and to just get myself ready for next season.\"\nDubois acknowledged he probably did not need more motivation after putting up just 40 points, the lowest of his career in a full, 82-game season. Kings general manager Rob Blake took responsibility for Dubois not being put in the right roles and the situation not being a great fit.\nThe trade gives Dubois, picked third by Columbus in the 2016 draft and traded to Winnipeg five years later for Patrik Laine and Jack Roslovic, another fresh start. Dubois is the Capitals' latest reclamation project, two summers after signing another center who was a No. 3 pick and already on his second team.\nThat one worked out swimmingly, with Dylan Strome establishing himself as an important part of Washington's evolving core in the final years of the Alex Ovechkin era. Strome and Dubois were actually roommates when they played together on Canada's world junior team in 2017.\n\"I'm sure that we'll push each other, and he'll teach me what he's learned already,\" Dubois said. \"To be able to play with him again will be really fun and get to know him again. Obviously, we're in different stages in life, but it'll be exciting.\"\nDubois is at the stage of trying to get back on track. On three previous occasions he scored 27 or more goals in a season, and GM Brian MacLellan when acquiring him said Dubois had immense potential to be a top-tier player because of his size, skating and hockey IQ — in part because he's expected to have a bigger role than in L.A.\n\"It was exactly what you want to hear as a player: How excited they are, how I can help in a lot of ways for this team,\" Dubois said of his first conversation with MacLellan. \"You want to feel welcome. You want to feel like you're a part of it.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

Of gold medals and deep 3s. Of the girl with the brown ponytail with the unlimited range who always seemed to know what was coming next and the blonde who never got rattled with the ball in her hands, by opponents or the sea of eyes constantly transfixed on her.\nYet ask Iowa's Caitlin Clark and UConn's Paige Bueckers their earliest impression of the other and you get generalities, light on details if heavy on respect.\nMaybe because those years shadowing each other on the travel circuit across the Midwest or teaming up for the occasional international competition seem so long ago. Maybe because in some ways — in the most meaningful of ways — they are.\nThe NCAA Tournament that Clark grew up watching in Iowa and Bueckers took in from the outskirts of Minneapolis doesn't exist anymore. Back then, the inequalities between the men's and women's versions of March Madness were massive, from facilities to swag to TV ratings, even the branding.\nIt's not that way anymore.\nNot with Clark and Iowa selling out everywhere they go. Not with Bueckers finally healthy after spending the better part of two years recovering from knee injuries that left her fearful the generational skills that made her the first freshman to win the AP Player of the Year award would never return.\nOnly they have. Just in time for the two players who have helped propel interest in the women's tournament to an all-time high to take center stage.\nWhen Clark and the top-seeded Hawkeyes face Bueckers and third-seeded UConn on Friday night in the Final Four, they'll do it not in some anonymous gym with nothing but parents, scouts and college coaches watching.\nThey will play in front of a packed arena with millions watching on television and millions more keeping track on social media, an ever-growing group that includes LeBron James and Steph Curry and Luka Doncic and aspiring ballers from all over.\nIt's not that women's basketball hasn't had stars before. It has. Just never quite as many as this who play quite like this.\nAnd while Iowa coach Lisa Bluder made it a point on Thursday to say she didn't want the national semifinal to be pitted as \"Caitlin vs. Paige,\" everyone else involved seems to be OK with the arrangement because of what it means for not just their respective teams, but the women's game in general.\n\"It's a star-driven society that we live in,\" UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. \"It's a celebrity-driven, star-driven, influencer-driven world that's been created.\"\nOne in which both Clark and Bueckers are comfortable traveling, perhaps because it's the only world they've ever known.\nBIRD VS. MAGIC 2.0? YES AND NOThe parallels to the rivalry between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird that began when Johnson and Michigan State faced Bird and Indiana State in the 1979 NCAA championship are obvious.\n\"All of a sudden those two particular players came on and it just lit everything up, and it just took off from there,\" Auriemma said. \"So it needs some stars. It needs people that have the right personality, the right game. And we have that now.\"\nThing is, Bueckers and Clark don't view themselves as rivals. Not in a traditional sense. If anything, they believe they're simply riding the crest of a wave that's been building for years, long before they reached a first-name-only level of fame.\nAsk Clark why interest in women's basketball has spiked and she doesn't point to her record-setting career or her \"did she really shoot that\" range or even her team's success but simple exposure.\nTo Clark, the women's game has always been great. It's just taken a while, a long while, for the world to catch up.\n\"It's the platforms that (we're able to have now) that should have been there for a really long time,\" Clark said. \"We've had some amazing talents come through our game, over the last 10, 20 years.\"\nTalents that haven't quite connected in the way that Clark and Bueckers have connected. The easing of rules surrounding name, image and likeness compensation has allowed them to market themselves and their game in ways once unimaginable.\nFOLLOWING LEGENDSIt's a history not lost on either of them. They understand and embrace the responsibility of being a role model, knowing they were once on the other end, looking up to the likes of college and WNBA stars Maya Moore and Lindsay Whalen.\n\"They were everything that I wanted to be like,\" Bueckers said. \"And they won.\"\nA trait that has followed Bueckers seemingly from the first time she picked up a ball. It's telling that when asked about Bueckers' game, Clark didn't talk about her impeccable court vision or precise midrange jumper but what the scoreboard says after nearly every game in which she plays.\n\"She's always been dominant,\" Clark said. \"Every team that she's ever been on, she's led them to great success. It's just what she does. She's a winner.\"\nThat hasn't changed, though the dynamics around the way Clark and Bueckers are perceived have flipped over the last three years.\nROLE REVERSALIt was Bueckers, not Clark, who was the top recruit in the Class of 2020. It was Bueckers, not Clark, who was recruited by the Huskies, though Auriemma did point out this week \"if Caitlin really wanted to come to UConn, she would have called me.\" It was Bueckers, not Clark, who won that first meeting in 2021 and became the \"media darling,\" as Bueckers put it Friday.\nClark is in that position now. Setting the NCAA Division I scoring record and playing with a fearlessness that is equal parts thrilling and accessible will do that.\nSecurity people had to clear a path deep inside Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Friday to make sure she could make it from one media opportunity to the next. When UConn and Bueckers came through an hour later, the throng was half the size.\nEven for a player who says on the court she can see things before they happen, it's been a lot. The 22-year-old Clark welcomes the attention because she understands it has brought new people to her sport. Yet she's not here to be The Star, as much as people want to thrust that moniker on her.\nThree years ago, it was Bueckers. The last two years, it's been her. Next spring it might be Bueckers during her redshirt senior season. Bueckers is leaning toward this year's blockbuster freshman class, a group that includes USC's JuJu Watkins or Notre Dame's Hannah Hidalgo. A decade from now, it might be some young woman who didn't pick up a ball until she watched Clark hoist it from deep and Bueckers weave through traffic in the lane.\nIn that way, Clark doesn't see herself or Bueckers as the end result of something, but simply the latest links in a chain growing ever stronger with each passing season.\n\"It doesn't need to be one end-all, be-all (star) just like I think there doesn't need to be one end-all, be-all team,\" Clark said. \"The young talent, it's only going to get better.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Talbot Board of Ed voices mixed opinions over 2025-26 calendar draft\n\n December 21, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: KONNER METZ kmetz@chespub.com | Section: Local News \n \n 548\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON — A draft version of a calendar for the 2025-2026 school year drew varying opinions from Talbot County Board of Education members on Wednesday evening.The calendar committee, which plans the district's upcoming calendars, put together the draft that was shown Wednesday. It included two days off in the second week of March 2026 for students and a five-day spring break for students from April 2 to April 6, 2026.\n\"The thinking of the committee was to put some days off in March, and then to do the April holiday,\" Helga Einhorn, assistant superintendent of school leadership and student success, said. \"Dividing the break would also minimize the impact on our students who rely on the support of our schools for their meal support.\"\nBoard President Emily Jackson, who serves on the calendar committee, expressed confusion with the draft calendar that Einhorn presented.\n\"It was a surprisingly contentious group, with a huge set of ideas that ran the gamut,\" Jackson said of the committee. \"So what I am seeing presented today, to me, does not accurately reflect what I took away from the discussions that were had.\"\nJackson said she was expecting multiple draft calendars, not just one. She added that past surveys have indicated there are strong opinions on extending spring break and having \"time for teachers in their classrooms without students.\"\n\"Personally, I come back to wanting to give our community what they're asking for,\" Jackson said. \"So I'm looking for a calendar that has an actual spring break on it.\"\nBoard Member Deborah Bridges said she liked the two days off in March.\n\"I think the March break is wonderful from a mental health standpoint, because March is long, dreary,\" Bridges said. \"And everybody — kids, parents and teachers — need a little break, and I think that's a really good thing to do.\"\nBoard Member Dyshekia Strawberry raised concerns that the shorter spring break could increase chronic absenteeism in April. Vice President Amy Dodson said while the draft calendar \"looks good,\" an off day in March could possibly be moved to extend spring break.\nJackson also brought up the possibility of staggered starts for students in \"transition\" grades that are starting at new schools. Einhorn said that she is waiting on direction from the state to understand how other districts do staggered starts while still complying with 180-day requirements.\nFeedback from Wednesday's meeting will be taken back to the calendar committee and discussed before a draft calendar is presented for second reader at the board's January meeting.\nEinhorn said it'd be possible for the committee to look at keeping the two off days in March, as well as extending spring break, by moving the last day of school back.\nJackson vouched for \"consistent breaks\" in order to accommodate student needs surrounding mental health, travel needs, college tours and more.\n\"There are ways to put this together that do make sense and don't look like this,\" the board president said.\n\"I think we have to put everything out on the table because we have constraints,\" Superintendent Sharon Pepukayi said. \"We can't have it both ways.\n\"And while I know we want extra days off, I hear loud and clear from parents (about) child care. But we also want to balance, because I also hear from staff, more planning time. We just have to find out, what is that balance?\" \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia). All rights reserved.",

The $1.1 million contract was passed unanimously.\nShafer said some preliminary work will be done this spring before school ends. The school play and other concerts or events won't be impacted, Shafer said.\nOver in Cordova, the under-renovation Chapel District Elementary School will receive glazing for its new windows. The window glazing is a security film, Shafer said, a safety measure that \"prevents easy access to the school building.\"\nAll other schools in the district have the window glazing.\nChapel District Elementary is currently under renovation, a multimillion endeavor expected to be done sometime in 2026.\nThe contract is through a Maryland Center for School Safety grant in the amount of $132,000 for the window glazing. Shafer said the district couldn't move forward with it during construction of the renovated school building due to cost limits during the bidding process.\nShafer said he hopes the window security upgrades can be completed this summer. The board unanimously approved the contract.\nBoard President Emily Jackson added that she has \"slight hesitations about privacy\" as it relates to windows in classrooms and libraries at Chapel District Elementary and other schools.\nJackson asked that the board hear more about potential school safety grants in the future, particularly \"in the privacy arena to provide more screening for our students.\" \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Former 1st-rounders Toney, Farley cut\n\n August 27, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Bill Haufe | Section: Sports \n \n 1124\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Kansas City receiver Kadarius Toney and Tennessee cornerback Caleb Farley, both first-round picks in the 2021 NFL draft, were among the cuts Tuesday as teams trimmed their rosters for the regular season.Toney, who figured to be on the roster bubble, was on his second team since the New York Giants drafted him 20th overall three years ago. The Titans took Farley two picks later.\nTeams had to cut their rosters to 53 players from the training camp maximum of 90. Toney, Farley and hundreds of others will be eligible to return on practice squads that allow up to 17 players, including a spot allocated for the International Player Pathway Program.\nMiami receiver Odell Beckham Jr. will begin the season on the physically unable to perform list, meaning he'll miss at least the first four games. Beckham has not seen the field with the Dolphins since signing a one-year contract in May.\nSan Francisco's initial roster is missing a big piece with holdout All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams remaining on the reserve/did not report list as he seeks a new deal. Star receiver Brandon Aiyuk is on the roster but has refused to practice unless he gets a new contract or is traded.\nInjuries shortened both of Toney's first two seasons, and he was traded to the Chiefs during his second year with the Giants. The 25-year-old never displayed his dynamic playmaking skills consistently, but did have a big role in the first of the two Super Bowl rings he got with the Chiefs.\nIn a three-minute span in the fourth quarter of Kansas City's 38-35 win over Philadelphia in Super Bowl 57, Toney made two monumental plays. First, he caught a 5-yard TD pass that gave the Chiefs a 28-27 lead. Then, he returned a punt 65 yards to the Eagles 5-yard line to set up another TD.\nBut Toney couldn't build off that success. He struggled last season, was inactive from Week 15 through the playoffs and sat out when the Chiefs finished their repeat against San Francisco.\nKansas City added veteran wideout Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown and drafted Xavier Worthy in the first round to go with Rashee Rice. The Chiefs also have Skyy Moore, Mecole Hardman and Justin Watson.\nThe Titans drafted Farley out of Virginia Tech after he was the first player from a major college to opt out of the 2020 season because of the pandemic. Farley was drafted weeks after a second surgery to repair a back injury from college.\nFarley started just twice as injuries limited him to 12 games over his first two seasons. Farley had another back procedure in 2023.\nThe 25-year-old never played last season. The Titans kept him on the physically unable to perform list after his father was killed last August in an explosion that destroyed Farley's home in North Carolina.\nArizona released quarterback Desmond Ridder, which means Clayton Tune will be Kyler Murray's backup. Ridder started 13 games for Atlanta last season before being traded to the Cardinals in the offseason.\nJacksonville released eight-year veteran quarterback C.J. Beathard with an injury designation, presumably clearing the way for Mac Jones to back up Trevor Lawrence. Jones started 42 games over the past three seasons with New England after the Patriots drafted him in the first round in 2021.\nReceiver JuJu Smith-Schuster was cut by the Chiefs after re-signing with them following his release by the Patriots this month.\nThe Cowboys put CeeDee Lamb on the commissioner exempt list a day after the All-Pro receiver agreed to a $136 million, four-year contract extension that ended his preseason-long holdout. Lamb signed the contract Tuesday.\nThe move allowed the Cowboys to put offensive lineman Chuma Edoga on the 53-man roster for a day. Lamb would take the place of Edoga, who could return from injured reserve sooner than four weeks.\nSeattle had outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu on the active roster, a sign the Seahawks believe the three-year starter can be ready in fewer than four games. Nwosu injured a knee in the preseason finale.\nThe New York Jets waived safety Jaylen Key, who was \"Mr. Irrelevant\" as the last pick in the draft. The former UAB and Alabama standout had a solid training camp, but was buried on the depth chart behind starters Chuck Clark and Tony Adams and veteran reserves Ashtyn Davis and Jarrick Bernard-Converse.\nThe Minnesota Vikings kept recovering tight end T.J. Hockenson on the physically unable to perform list, meaning the two-time Pro Bowler must miss at least the first four games. Hockenson is working through the final stage of his rehabilitation after tearing an ACL against Detroit last Dec. 24.\nThe Vikings waived safety Lewis Cine, the final pick of the first round two years ago in the first draft directed by general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah.\nCine badly broke his leg on special teams in a game early in his rookie year and never made much traction on the depth chart last season. He played a total of 10 defensive snaps in two seasons.\nDenver let go of receiver Tim Patrick, whose TD in the second preseason game was his first in 974 days. Patrick, who sustained season-ending injuries at start of training camp in 2022 and '23, had a solid summer but was victim of the Broncos' depth at his position.\nAs expected, Cleveland placed star running back Nick Chubb on the physically unable to perform list as he continues to recover from two surgeries last year. The club is optimistic Chubb will play this season.\nThe Browns released running back D'Onta Foreman, who overcame a scary neck injury in training camp. With Nyheim Hines on the non-football injury list, the Browns currently have only Jerome Ford and Pierre Strong Jr. at running back.\nWashington released veteran receiver Martavis Bryant, who is in his second season of trying to end a long hiatus from the NFL.\nThe oft-suspended 32-year-old, who last played in the NFL in 2018, spent most of last season on Dallas' practice squad and could land in the same place with the Commanders, who signed him Aug. 13.\nFor the second season in a row, the Saints are making a change at punter, and again, they're going with an Australian rookie. This time it's 27-year-old Matthew Hayball taking over for 31-year-old Lou Hedley, who surprisingly won the job a year earlier.\nThe Buffalo Bills released receiver K.J. Hamler, their primary preseason returner, and filled the hole on special teams by acquiring defensive back Brandon Codrington in a trade with the AFC East rival Jets. The teams swapped late-round picks in next year's draft.\nSafety Ronnie Harrison (Colts), linebacker Deion Jones (Bills), running backs Matt Breida (49ers), Joshua Kelley (Giants) and Boston Scott (Rams), quarterbacks Mike White (Dolphins), Ben DiNucci (Bills), Matt Corral (Vikings) and Ian Book (Chiefs), wide receivers Sterling Shepard (Buccaneers) and Greg Ward (Colts) and defensive back Terrell Edmunds (Jaguars) also were cut. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Everything you see is either grown here or produced here. Nothing is flown in. It is supporting and sustaining our own food production on the Shore.\"\nThe full scale market opening on April 20 will be an expansion of the Avalon Foundation's Winter Market, which it has run in the off-season. The full market will run until the second week of December, after which the Winter Market will pick back up.\n\"This year was the first that we went all year round with some vendors. This constitutes the opening of the Spring Market in its full glory as we expand to fill the entire municipal lot,\" Nuthall said. \"We have lots of vegetables because many of our farmers are growing in high tunnels. We do have vendors there this Saturday, but the full market won't open until April 20.\"\nThe market is located in a municipal parking lot on the 100 block of North Harrison Street in downtown Easton.\nSome of the vendors include Triangle Acres, Cottingham Farm, Honeybee Flower Farm, The Federal Brewing Company, CD Produce, Quarter Acre Farm and Gingersnap Farm.\nThe market will have several bakeries, produce growers and local honey. It will have woodworking and textile crafts for sale, along with other locally-made goods. There will be live music every Saturday starting at 10:30 a.m.\nAn interactive map of vendors is available at maps.managemymarket.\nNuthall said in addition to being able to view the roster of vendors for the duration of the calendar year, those who visit the link can also view vendor contact information, the types of items they sell and their location in the market.\nThere is parking available at Brewer's Lane, or the lot on the corner of Washington and Bay Streets. There will be a marked accessible parking space for those with disability parking needs.\nThe St. Michaels Farmers Market will be open from April 13 to Nov. 23 on Saturdays from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. It is located on 206 S. Talbot Street.\n\"(St. Michaels Farmers Market) is in its 27th season and is the small town, producer-only farmers market of Maryland's Eastern Shore,\" said Market Manager Sandy Lawler. \"We are also the only market on the Eastern Shore that has a SNAP dollar for dollar matching program.\"\nLike Easton, the St. Michaels market has a wide array of bakers, farmers and artisans. Some of these include Little Fields Floral, Tilghman Island Baking, D&D Dog Treats, Scottish Highland Creamery, Chesapeake Mushrooms and Lyon Rum. There is also a weekly changing community and education tent and weekly musicians. Building African American Minds will be in the community and education tent on opening day.\nFor veggies, vendors include Shaky Wheelbarrow Herb Sales, Krieder's Tomatoes, Oksana's Produce Farm, Vintage Family Farm and Mindful Acres. Cottingham will have organic vegetables.\nNight Kitchen Coffee Roasters, Casa Carmen Wines, Willwaw Farm, Fat and Happy Farms and Agave Juice and Elysium Farm will all be offering their creations.\nLawler put her finger on why this market is so enduring.\n\"Farmers Markets are important for so many reasons,\" she said. \"... The biggest one is the support of our own community. Neighbor feeding neighbor with minimal transport, which means fresher healthier products including a lower environmental impact. Knowing your farmer means you are buying from someone who is a steward of the land.\"\nOpening day, the market will have Talbot County Public Schools students playing from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m., followed by WabiSabi to close.\nFor more information, call 410-713-0507. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Weather conditions caused the school system to close for the entire day.\nDorchester County Public Schools also closed for the day due to icy road conditions. Caroline County Public Schools closed for students, but offices opened at 10 a.m. for its 12-month employees.\nEaston's Superintendent of Public Works Mike Dickerson said Easton Public Works used 46.92 tons of salt to keep the town's roadways safe. He said the department applied salt to the town's main roads — roads like Washington Street that get you into town — three times.\nAfter receiving a notification from the Talbot County Department of Emergency Services, Easton Public Works began salting roads at 4 p.m. Monday. Dickerson said the last of the department's five trucks finished salting for the third time at 4:44 a.m. on Tuesday.\n\"We had five trucks out,\" he said. \"And each one of them has an assigned route.\"\nAccording to the National Weather Service, winter weather advisories for Queen Anne's, Talbot and Caroline counties were issued early Tuesday morning and in effect until 1 p.m. on Tuesday.\nThe advisories were for mixed precipitation with additional snow of up to an inch and ice accumulation of around one 10th of an inch. The advisories stated that morning commutes could be affected due to slippery road conditions.\nDorchester County received a winter weather advisory from the National Weather Service for freezing rain and additional ice accumulation. The advisory was in effect until 11 a.m. Tuesday morning.\nAs of noon on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service, snow and freezing rain were likely in Easton before 1 p.m. with a chance of rain and snow between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. and a chance of more snow after 2 p.m. Little or no snow accumulation is expected. A tenth of an inch of ice accumulation is possible.\nDickerson said Easton Public Works has its trucks prepared in the event that employees have to go back out to take care of the roads. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

The car did not stop, and a pursuit ensued.\nBody-worn camera footage was released from four officers: Talbot County Deputies Brittanie DiMichele, William Barnett and Owen Joseph, and Easton Police Department Officer Nicholas Lange.\nDiMichele led the pursuit as Joseph drove a second county police vehicle with Barnett in the passenger's seat. The driver of the car being pursued did not stop and continued to drive on Route 50. Officers pursued the vehicle for several minutes, sometimes reaching speeds over 100 MPH.\n\"We looked at our policy and we looked at the body-worn camera footage,\" Talbot County Sheriff Joe Gamble said in an interview. \"We listened to the dispatch record of our deputies as well as the communication behind the deputies, and our deputies followed proper procedure and policies.\"\nIn the video, officers can be seen taking a left turn onto Black Dog Alley just before stopping and exiting to approach the crashed vehicle at the 8300 block at 7:14 p.m.\n\"Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands,\" DiMichele shouted. The armed deputies asked for the people in the car to put their hands out the window.\nDiMichele approached the rear passenger door on the left side, slightly opening it as repeated asks for \"help\" can be heard from inside the car. The rear passenger pressed his hands on the window, as Barnett repeatedly asked the driver, a juvenile male, to stick his hands out the window.\n\"If you keep reaching, you're going to get shot if you pull something out, you understand me?\" Barnett said.\nGamble said it is \"totally appropriate\" for the officers to draw their weapons while approaching the vehicle.\n\"For their safety, they drew their weapons, ordered the people out,\" Gamble said. \"Once they realized the injuries and there was entrapment, then they holstered their weapons and tried to assist.\"\nBarnett asked the driver if he had any weapons, then began to attempt to help the driver exit the car at 7:16 p.m.\n\"We're here to help you now, okay, I need you to climb out this window,\" Barnett said.\nThe two rear passengers, a juvenile male and an adult woman, exited the car with assistance from the officers.\nOfficers were unable to extract the adult woman from the front passenger seat. \"She's just agonal,\" an officer said of her breathing. One officer noted she \"definitely wasn't wearing a seatbelt.\" EMS arrived on the scene at 7:22 p.m., the video shows.\nThe driver and the front seat passenger were transported to a local hospital for treatment of serious injuries. The front seat passenger was later pronounced dead at the hospital, the attorney general's office said.\nThe decedent was previously identified as 18-year-old Yemaya Wilson.\nThe two rear passengers were transported to an area hospital for treatment of serious injuries.\nIn an August interview, Gamble said after the crash, police learned the vehicle had been stolen from Montgomery County.\n\"We suspect the criminal charges will be brought at some point in the case, against, at the very least, the driver of the stolen vehicle, if not more,\" Gamble said on Wednesday. \"But that's going to be in the hands of the (Maryland) State Police and the Talbot County State's Attorney's Office.\"\nThe Independent Investigations Division will generally release body-worn camera and dashboard camera footage within 20 business days of an incident. The release of body-worn camera footage in this incident was delayed to allow additional time to conduct witness interviews, the Attorney General's Office said in a press release.\nThe Independent Investigations Division continues to investigate the circumstances of the fatal pursuit.\nThis report has been updated from an earlier version to include comment from the Talbot County Sheriff and more details about the event.{iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9msnyhxgddI?si=ryU7ae89GJOWvceC\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"}{/iframe} \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Pelosi, Biden: A fractured political friendship\n\n August 24, 2024 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: DAVID REEL | Section: Columns \n \n 687\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n Since President Biden withdrew from seeking re-election in late July, there has been speculation about the individual or individuals most responsible for that happening.On a nationally televised address, Biden said, in part, \"So, I've decided the best way forward, is to pass the torch to a new generation.\"\nThat announcement followed a series of Biden's emphatic denials that he would step down from running for a second term despite almost universal agreement that his debate performance against Donald Trump was a disaster.\nOn June 28, Biden acknowledged his poor debate performance but vowed to \"fight on.\"On July 5, Biden said, \"If the Lord Almighty came down and said, 'Joe, get out of the race,' I'd get out of the race. The Lord Almighty's not comin' down.\"On July 8, Biden said, \"I'm not going anywhere.\"On July 11, Biden said, \"It's essentially a toss-up race.\"On July 21, Biden announces he is leaving the presidential race.\nSince then, there has been widespread speculation on the role of Nancy Pelosi on this outcome. Despite no longer serving as speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi is proof that power and influence in politics is not always based on a position.\nSome believe strongly that Pelosi played a key role, if not the key role in convincing Biden to abandon his re-election campaign.\nWhen asked if she helped apply pressure on Biden, Pelosi initially responded with, \"I didn't call one person.\" She later acknowledged she did make a call to one person and that was President Biden. On that call she opined that based on polling his re-election prospects were dismal and that would have significant negative impacts on Democratic candidates in competitive down ballot races.\nShe has also admitted she took calls from key Democratic Party power brokers and opinion leaders where she expressed the same concerns she raised on her call with Biden.\nWhen Nancy Pelosi talks about politics, most people listen. When she doesn't talk, most people notice her silence especially on matters like the viability of a Biden bid for a second term.\nNow that Biden has stepped down from running, she has been somewhat more forthright.\nAt a recent roundtable with reporters, she still insisted she did not lead a behind-the-scenes effort to pressure President Biden to drop his re-election bid. The operative word here is \"lead.\" While she may not have led those behind-the-scenes efforts there is increasing evidence she was very involved in them.\nLike so many past and present events in politics, we may never get the full story.\nWe do know that this chain of events reinforces the brutal reality of politics. Whenever a candidate becomes unelectable, they become expendable.\nUltimately, who Pelosi called or did not call, did or did take calls from, exactly what was said or not said on any of those calls, a mission she was involved to some degree to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee became mission accomplished.\nAchieving that mission formerly viewed by many as \"mission impossible\" has been a game changer in the 2024 presidential election and beyond. It has energized, galvanized, and mobilized a previously despondent Democratic Party. It increases the odds for Democrats to control at least one or both houses of Congress starting next year.\nIt has also forced the Trump campaign to explore adjustments to a campaign strategy that did not ask the question — what if Biden is not the opponent?\nThis change is not without some residual turbulence in the Democratic Party.\nPolitico recently reported Biden is angry with Nancy Pelosi. Their report includes the following quote from an anonymous senior White House official: \"Biden views Pelosi as 'ruthless' and willing to set aside long-term relationships in order to keep her party in power.\"\nAs a result, Pelosi has said she and Biden have not spoken since July 19.\nBased on the late scheduling and even later delivery of Biden's speech at the DNC convention it is clear the Democratic Party has no time for him going forward.\nI suggest Joe Biden needs to heed advice attributed to former Democratic President Harry Truman: \"If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.\"\nDavid Reel is a public affairs and public relations consultant who lives in Easton. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

    "content": "Jury finds Tilghman man guilty of child sexual abuse\n\n November 3, 2023 | Star Democrat, The (Easton, MD)\n\n Author/Byline: Natalie Jones; njones@chespub.com | Page: 3 | Section: News \n \n 732\n Words \n\n Read News Document\n\n EASTON - After roughly five hours of deliberation Thursday, a Talbot County jury found a Tilghman man guilty on all but one count relating to the sexual abuse of a child earlier this year.The jury found Eric L. Werner guilty of 16 counts, including sexual abuse of a minor, third-and fourth-degree sex offenses, second-degree assault and displaying obscene matter to a minor.However, the jury did not convict Werner on one count of sexual abuse of a minor.The verdict comes after a four-day jury trial in Talbot County Circuit Court.The child's mother, whom the Star Democrat is not naming to protect the victim's privacy, expressed gratitude for the guilty verdict.\"Justice has been served today,\" she said in an email. \"We can't thank the Talbot County Sheriff's (Office), and the Talbot County State's Attorney's Office enough for their dedication to this case and the support that they've given my daughter and our family these past 8 months.\" She continued: \"I'd also like to express how important it is that parents, and guardians educate themselves and their children on the statistics and signs of sexual abuse and grooming. Empower your kids to speak up if someone is hurting them, being inappropriate with them, or making them feel uncomfortable. If your child discloses abuse to you, believe them, support them, and report the abuse to authorities or a mandatory reporter.\" \"What happened to my daughter was horrible, but it could have been a lot worse if she had not spoken up when she did.She will carry this trauma with her for the rest of her life, but we all hope that because she spoke up, it will help encourage another child to do the same and stop their abuse.\" Defense attorney Philip Cronan said he was disappointed in the verdict, but would see what comes next with sentencing, which is yet to be scheduled.Detectives from the Talbot County Sheriff's Office began investigating Werner, 61, in February after learning of multiple child sexual abuse incidents that occurred at a home in Tilghman that month.Police investigation revealed that Werner sexually assaulted a preteen girl through inappropriately touching her on three different occasions in February.Werner showed the child pornographic videos, which the child remembered in detail during the trial. Police testified to a specific adult website appearing in Werner's phone's search history.In closing arguments Thursday, Talbot County Deputy State's Attorney Chelsea Endzel highlighted the testimony and evidence presented during the trial as concrete proof that Werner established an inappropriate relationship with the child, grooming her, she said.Numerous text messages between the two, plus the child testifying to Werner initiating sexual conversations with her, further illustrated the inappropriate relationship, Endzel said.Later, Werner, asking the child to delete messages, indicated that he continued to coax the child into becoming comfortable with sexual contact, she added.Endzel also pointed to recordings of calls Werner made to his wife while in the county jail as additional corroboration for his guilt. During one call, Werner said the truth would get him \"into some trouble.\" And during another, he attempted to discredit her, telling his wife they needed to give a reason why she would lie, Endzel said.Countering the prosecution, Cronan acknowledged that the allegations against Werner would bother any juror, but questioned what the prosecution presented as facts.A point of contention between both attorneys Thursday morning was whether or not Werner had permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of the child - criteria that needed to be met to move forward with the sexual abuse of a minor charges.Though Talbot Circuit Judge Stephen H. Kehoe ruled that the prosecution had provided evidence demonstrating that Werner had temporary responsibility for the child during the incidents, Cronan still questioned if there was a change in responsibility between adults during his closing arguments.Cronan also questioned the consistency of the child's statements made to police compared to what she testified to on the witness stand, urging the jurors to find Werner not guilty if they only thought he \"probably\" or \"maybe\" touched the child inappropriately.In her final remarks to the jurors, Endzel said the child had no incentive to lie. She turned attention back to Werner, again highlighting his request for the child to delete text messages and pointing to the jail calls attempting to discredit her story.\"If that's not consciousness of guilt, I don't know what is,\" she said. \n \n Caption: ERIC WERNER \n\n © Copyright © 2023 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

County Manager Clay Stamp vouched for the 1-cent resolution funding.\n\"In the last number of years, this additional funding has allowed us to see the best of our services,\" said Stamp, who is also the county's former emergency services director. \"We've stabilized our workforce. We've been able to attract quality individuals as paramedics, correctional officers, deputy sheriffs. We've enhanced our technology, we've enhanced our coverage.\"\nThe original resolution from 2020 amended the charter for five years up until July 1, 2026. Resolution 359, which was passed Tuesday, adds an additional seven years.\nOriginally, Resolution 359 was introduced as extending five years. Council Vice President Pete Lesher proposed an amendment Tuesday to tack on the two additional years.\nHis reasoning for the amendment was to ensure any future extensions can be voted on by the public during presidential elections, when the ballot is more \"uncrowded\" than other elections. County council and gubernatorial elections are set to be in 2026 and 2030, meaning that if extended to only 2031, the 1-cent question may have appeared on a crowded 2030 ballot.\n\"By adding another two years, rather than having this expire in a council election year (or) a gubernatorial election year, this will extend it to the next presidential election year so that should this need to be renewed another time, it can be done when there isn't such a crowded ballot,\" Lesher said.\nCouncil members unanimously approved the amendment 4-0 before passing the resolution by the same vote, with Council Member Dave Stepp absent.\nSparks said she's seen where the additional tax revenue has been spent, which is in \"the areas that the public has supported,\" noting the new positions and increased funding to volunteer fire departments.\n\"It's very important for the public to know that they're doing good things to help us,\" Council President Chuck Callahan said. \n\n © Copyright © 2024 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

In the story, farmer Abe allows Donkey (the chicken) to not only sit on chicken eggs, but also duck eggs.\nWell, Donkey ends up with a new lease on life, and when those ducks hatch, she cares for those ducklings like they are her very own.\nFarmer Abe learns a valuable lesson from that. If a chicken can learn to love something so different, he can love people different from him too.\nAnd \"writer Abe\" can instruct people that a chicken and duck cannot interbreed, and the chicken is simply incubating the duck eggs then loving the ducklings as her own.\nThis kind of love transcends, and is repeated again in Abe's second book: \"Moo Moo the Dog Adopts a Baby Pig,\" published in December 2023.\nThe theme is, you guessed it, Moo Moo the dog taking care of a baby pig, even more different than a duck and a chicken, and offers another powerful lesson about acceptance to Farmer Abe.\nKey's third book, \"Kitty the Goat and the Puppy\" has been delayed in shipment, but he is hoping for an Easter release. For his other books, you can find them on Amazon and some local book stores or contact him directly.\nThis time around Farmer Abe will learn from Kitty the goat, taking care of a puppy.\nThe story goes, Kitty the goat lives on a farm. He's a prize goat, but retires and like many in the limelight, gets depressed. And like many of us, depression gives way to mischief. Kitty is eating up the flower beds and gnawing on the clothesline as goats often do.\nWhat breaks Kitty from those bad habits is raising a little puppy, and through this puppy, Kitty finds purpose again.\nThe lesson?\nChoose love.\nIt's a lesson that resounds with many readers to the joy of Keys, especially in schools where love and acceptance is a key focus, he said.\nWriting with no expectations, his first book did amazingly well. Within weeks of publishing he had schools waiting to buy 300 books and since then has sold 3-4,000 copies of the book.\nHis foray into writing began with a challenge from friends, and he is glad he went through with it, Keys said. Finding a local artist to complement his stories, he discovered a very special niche combining children's books and agriculture along with a message of love and acceptance.\nWith plenty of source material too, drawing from his family owning farmland in Canada, South America and Montana, he's creating the fourth book, where the animal theme will continue. The last book of the series will explore Farmer's Abe's past with a very special horse.\nKeys success has continued to grow. He has been featured in four newspapers, including a story in Montana the place of his birth, a paper in Canada, and television broadcasts in Salisbury, Maryland in addition to being invited to several local schools.\nAs many story tellers will say, there are all kinds of ideas running around in his mind, but he is focusing on finishing out the series first.\nAnd he is honing his craft, drawing inspiration from others like Jay Miletsky, author of 14 books including \"Ricky the Rock Who Couldn't Roll.\"\nKeys will further challenge himself as he prepares to attend his first writer's summit in Nashville, Tennessee. He will have the chance to connect with fellow authors, pitch his ideas to professionals and learn from longtime experts.\nThrilled with the possibilities ahead, he takes with him lessons from his latest book. \"Farmer Abe was reminded that when given the chance, to always choose love. Because you just never know if the love you give to others might also change your life forever,\" Keys wrote.\nBased on his whirlwind author's journey so far, it seems like he's on to something rather special.\nFor information about his books, Keys encourages you to contact him directly at 410-708-5164, or find him on Facebook under Abraham Keys. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

They say it is and always has been the way of the world in which we live.\nIt has also been said that the public should not be surprised or upset when details emerge on behavior by elected and appointed government that is illegal or unethical.\nOthers have said illegal and unethical behavior is never acceptable.\nThey say the media has an obligation to report it, and those who engage in such behavior must be held accountable and punished to the maximum extent of the law.\nSome have said, while such behavior is bipartisan, more often than not, it is overlooked or excused by some of the national media when it involves Democratic presidents.\nThey cite the levels of reporting by the national media on Bill Clinton's involvement with Monica Lewinsky, compared to Richard Nixon's involvement with Watergate.\nUntil recently, Nixon has been almost universally viewed as the least ethical and least honest president in U.S. history.\nJohn Kass, a former Chicago Tribune political reporter and columnist has challenged that view by writing \"… this one about Biden is much worse than the Watergate break-in. In that one the White House covered up the lawbreaking and the media uncovered it.\"\nEven Jake Tapper has suggested that may be true in saying publicly, the \"cover-up of the former president's mental decline may be a worse scandal than Watergate.\"\nWith that in mind, Congressional investigations are already underway on Biden's levels of awareness of and involvement on decisions made during his presidency.\nMore are likely to come.\nIt will be most interesting to learn answers given under oath to three questions:\nWas there at any point during the Biden presidency, when, as a result of Biden's physical and mental health conditions, decisions that are the exclusive responsibility of an elected president were instead made by an individual or individuals other than the elected President?\nIf so and perhaps without President Biden being aware of it, did these individuals break the law, that is, by using autopen signatures on executive orders and pardons?\nWas the media complicit if they ignored or did not follow-up with due diligence on these matters?\nOther questions will not be answered until next year's midterm elections.\nHow many decisions were made by voters based on their support for or opposition to President Trump's agenda?\nHow many decisions were made on whether or not there was conclusive evidence of a coverup of President Biden's levels of engagement during all four years of his presidency?\nWill the latter reflect an increasing loss of voter confidence in national news media outlets?\nThere are already signs of significant loss in that confidence in some of the national media.\nTapper's own CNN show had its lowest-rated month since August 2015. That should put every member of the news division of the national media on notice.\nThere are measurable and profound consequences on ignoring and disrespecting what Americans expect from national political news providers.\nGoing forward, American voters deserve three things from the national media.\nFact-based news with no hidden agendas.\nVigorous pursuit and continuous exposure of verifiable unethical and/or illegal behavior by every elected and appointed government official.\nNo group think — a psychological phenomenon when conclusions are not the result of a lack of information, but because of a conscious decision to put conformity above critical thinking.\nUntil that happens, all the excuses and explanations from the national media who failed to do their job during the Biden presidential years will be nothing more than too little, too late. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).

Jones said the center opposes a potential repeal of the diversity statement.\n\"One of the things that our government is supposed to be is representative of all people, and that includes people in marginalized communities,\" Jones said.\nThe resolution's title on the agenda states that it would repeal two 2020 resolutions \"regarding diversity training and development of a Talbot County diversity statement, respectively.\"\nThe first 2020 resolution implemented an annual report of diversity training opportunities offered to staff. The second facilitated the creation of Talbot County's diversity statement, which is now found in its employee handbook.\nThe statement defines diversity, equity and inclusion, explains its purpose and details the county's approach to ensuring diversity. It also outlines how employees can report discrimination.\nStepp, who joined the council in 2022, confirmed to The Star Democrat that he is bringing forward the new resolution.\n\"I certainly think there's a lot of folks that are out there that are trying to make this something that it isn't,\" Stepp said in an interview. \"It's all financial in nature.\"\nIn a letter written to residents Tuesday, Stepp stated the resolution's purpose is to keep Talbot County \"in good standing with the federal agencies providing funds\" to the county. He said it's not an attack against the county's diversity and inclusion.\nStepp's letter makes mention of President Donald Trump's Jan. 20 executive order to end all diversity, equity and inclusion policies and programs in the federal government.\n\"What this proposed resolution will do is protect the Talbot County taxpayer from potentially not receiving the millions of dollars Talbot County already receives annually from the Federal Government,\" Stepp wrote.\nFormer Talbot County Council President Corey Pack brought forth the initial resolutions in the summer of 2020. In an interview Tuesday, he said the diversity statement was meant to \"memorialize\" what the council was already doing regarding diversity, equity and inclusion in the workforce.\nPack hopes any attempt to repeal fails and said he's disappointed the council may be looking to remove the statement.\n\"Put your money where your mouth is,\" Pack said. \"If this is what you are about as a governmental body, what's wrong with putting that in writing? If you are a governmental body that believes in diversity, that believes in inclusion, that believes in equality, what's the fear?\"\nCounty Council Vice President Pete Lesher was on the council when the two resolutions were passed in the summer of 2020. He said he hasn't noticed anything that would lead him to \"try to attempt to remove them.\"\n\"I've gone back and read over the language of the diversity statement, and I can't imagine what in there anybody would find objectionable,\" Lesher said in an interview.\nLesher added that he's worried removing the diversity statement could hurt the recruitment and retention of county government staff.\n\"I don't know that somebody would come here on the basis of whether or not we have these statements,\" he said, \"but the publicity of actually proactively removing such a statement might send a signal that some people aren't welcome here.\"\nBefore Tuesday's meeting was canceled, groups such as the Delmarva Pride Center and Talbot County Democratic Forum encouraged members to attend the meeting and speak against the proposal.\n\"Our community voices matter. Together we can defeat this transparent challenge to the Eastern Shore value of treating others with dignity and respect at all times,\" wrote Michele Dappert, forum president, in a newsletter Saturday. \"The community must speak out to ensure this progress is not erased.\"\nThe proposed resolution is expected to be on the agenda for the Talbot County Council's next meeting on Tuesday, Feb. 25. \n\n © Copyright © 2025 Star Democrat, Chesapeake Publishing Group (Adams Publishing/APGMedia).
