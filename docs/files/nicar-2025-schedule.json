In this panel, reporters will explore strategies for locating reliable international datasets and navigating the obstacles that come with using them. From language barriers to currency conversions, inconsistent formats, and varying levels of data transparency, journalists must adapt to diverse contexts to uncover the story within the data. Panelists will share practical solutions for addressing these challenges, including best practices for working with multilingual datasets, standardizing metrics across borders, and verifying sources in regions with limited transparency. Additionally, the session will tackle the complex issue of obtaining documents and records in countries where public records laws are weak, inefficient, or nonexistent. Panelists will highlight creative approaches to accessing critical information, from building local partnerships to leveraging non-traditional sources.\nKey questions for discussion during the panel:\n- What are the most effective methods for identifying and accessing reliable global data sources?\n- What unique challenges do international datasets present—such as language barriers, currency discrepancies, or incompatible formats—and what strategies can help overcome them?\n- How can journalists access critical documents in countries where public records laws are weak, inefficient, or nonexistent?","session_type":"Panel","start_time":"2025-03-06T15:00:00Z","end_time":"2025-03-06T16:00:00Z","duration_mins":60,"duration_formatted":"1h","evergreen":false,"cost":"","prereg_link":"","sponsor":"","recorded":true,"audio_recording_link":"","skill_level":"","speakers":[{"first":"Helena","last":"Bengtsson","affiliation":"Gota Media","bio":"Helena Bengtsson is data journalism editor at Gota Media, a regional publishing company in the south of Sweden with 14 local titles.

They also often require customization to meet the needs of the day's story accurately and cleanly. These two requirements are often at odds with one another. Graphics libraries that let you make charts quickly are often not customizable. The most customizable graphics framework, D3, often requires a great deal of prep and code to even make a simple bar chart.\n\nIn this presentation, we'll look at Layer Cake, which is a graphics framework in Svelte built for these twin demands of a newsroom. Its approach is different from most frameworks or libraries you may have worked with and we'll look at how you can create reusable code to  produce engaging graphics in a fast-paced environment.\n\nThis session is good for people who have knowledge of JavaScript and D3 already and want to learn how to translate that to Svelte. Experience with Svelte is not required but will be helpful. We'll discuss the philosophy behind project code as much as possible.
