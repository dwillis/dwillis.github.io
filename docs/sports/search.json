    "text": "1 Throwing cold water on hot takes\nWhy do teams struggle? There are lots of potential reasons: injuries, athletes in the wrong position, poor execution. Or it could be external factors: well-prepared opponents, the weather, the altitude or, of course, the refs.\nYou could turn the question around: why do teams succeed? Again, there are plenty of possibilities that get tossed around on talk radio, on the sports pages and across social media. A lot of hot takes.\nThe more fundamental question that this course will empower you to answer is this: what do teams and athletes do? Using data, you’ll learn to ask questions and visualize the answers, ranging across sports and scenarios. What did the 2021-22 Maryland men’s lacrosse team do well en route to the national championship? How has the transfer portal (and additional eligibility) changed the nature of programs? In football, do penalties have any relationship on scoring?\nTo get into these and other questions, we’ll use a lot of different tools and techniques, but this class rests on three pillars:\nDo you need to be a math whiz to read this book? No. I’m not one either. What we’re going to look at is pretty basic, but that’s also why it’s so powerful.\nDo you need to be a computer science major to write code? Nope. I’m not one of those either. But anyone can think logically, and write simple code that is repeatable and replicable.\nDo you need to be an artist to create compelling visuals? I think you see where this is going. No. I can barely draw stick figures, but I’ve been paid to make graphics in my career. With a little graphic design know how, you can create publication worthy graphics with code.",

The free version is great.\n\nGoing forward, you’ll see passages like this:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nDon’t do it now, but that is code that you’ll need to run in your RStudio.

    "text": "2.1 Adding libraries, part 1\nR is a programming language, one specifically geared toward statistical analysis. Like all programming languages, it has certain built-in functions and you can interact with it in multiple ways. The first, and most basic, is the console.\nThink of the console like talking directly to R. It’s direct, but it has some drawbacks and some quirks we’ll get into later. For now, try typing this into the console and hit enter:\nCongrats, you’ve run some code. It’s not very complex, and you knew the answer before hand, but you get the idea. We can compute things. We can also store things. In programming languages, these are called variables. We can assign things to variables using &lt;-. And then we can do things with them. The &lt;- is a called an assignment operator.\nNow assign a different number to the variable number. Try running number * number again. Get what you expected?\nWe can have as many variables as we can name. We can even reuse them (but be careful you know you’re doing that or you’ll introduce errors). Try this in your console.\nWe can store anything in a variable. A whole table. An array of numbers. Every college basketball game played in the last 10 years. A single word. A whole book. All the books of the 18th century. They’re really powerful. We’ll explore them at length.\nThe real strength of any given programming language is the external libraries that power it. The base language can do a lot, but it’s the external libraries that solve many specific problems – even making the base language easier to use.\nFor this class, we’re going to need several external libraries.\nThe first library we’re going to use is called Swirl. So in the console, type install.packages('swirl') and hit enter. That installs swirl.\nNow, to use the library, type library(swirl) and hit enter. That loads swirl. Then type swirl() and hit enter. Now you’re running swirl. Follow the directions on the screen. When you are asked, you want to install course 1 R Programming: The basics of programming in R. Then, when asked, you want to do option 1, R Programming, in that course.\nWhen you are finished with the course – it will take just a few minutes – it will first ask you if you want credit on Coursera. You do not. Then type 0 to exit (it will not be very clear that’s what you do when you are done).",

    "text": "2.2 Adding libraries, part 2\nWe’ll mostly use two libraries for analysis – dplyr and ggplot2. To get them, and several other useful libraries, we can install a single collection of libraries called the tidyverse. Type this into your console: install.packages('tidyverse')\nNOTE: This is a pattern. You should always install libraries in the console.\nThen, to help us with learning and replication, we’re going to use R Notebooks. So we need to install that library. Type this into your console: install.packages('rmarkdown')",

    "text": "2.3 Notebooks\nFor the rest of the class, we’re going to be working in notebooks. In notebooks, you will both run your code and explain each step, much as I am doing here.\nTo start a notebook, you click on the green plus in the top left corner and go down to R Notebook. Do that now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will see that the notebook adds a lot of text for you. It tells you how to work in notebooks – and you should read it. The most important parts are these:\nTo add text, simply type. To add code you can click on the Insert button on the toolbar or by pressing Cmd+Option+I on Mac or Ctl+Alt+I on Windows.\nHighlight all that text and delete it. You should have a blank document. This document is called a R Markdown file – it’s a special form of text, one that you can style, and one you can include R in the middle of it. Markdown is a simple markup format that you can use to create documents. So first things first, let’s give our notebook a big headline. Add this:\n# My awesome notebook\nNow, under that, without any markup, just type This is my awesome notebook.\nUnder that, you can make text bold by writing It is **really** awesome.\nIf you want it italics, just do this on the next line: No, it's _really_ awesome. I swear.\nTo see what it looks like without the markup, click the Preview or Knit button in the toolbar. That will turn your notebook into a webpage, with the formatting included.\nThroughout this book, we’re going to use this markdown to explain what we are doing and, more importantly, why we are doing it. Explaining your thinking is a vital part of understanding what you are doing.\nThat explaination, plus the code, is the real power of notebooks. To add a block of code, follow the instructions from above: click on the Insert button on the toolbar or by pressing Cmd+Option+I on Mac or Ctl+Alt+I on Windows.\nIn that window, use some of the code from above and add two numbers together. To see it run, click the green triangle on the right. That runs the chunk. You should see the answer to your addition problem.\nAnd that, just that, is the foundation you need to start this book.",
