      <description>Scoring from inside the red zone is a good thing for NFL teams. Doing it consistently is even better. The Miami Dolphins began the season with the league’s highest rate of scoring success inside opponents’ 20 yard line. Did they keep it up?
Using Expected Points Added, a metric that tries to quantify how much a play increases or decreases a team’s chances of scoring, ESPN reported that through the first three weeks of the season that the Dolphins had one of the best records in expected points added per play in the red zone.</description>

      <description>Staying on Offense in the Big Ten The Big Ten had some of the nation’s more prolific offenses last season. I’m going to make a bar chart of the teams’ average number of offensive plays over the course of the season so I can see which team was lining up the most on average.
